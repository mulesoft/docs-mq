You can view a chart indicating how much data and how many API requests have been consumed, and how many message units were received.

* Each message unit contains 100 KB of data.
+
Message units are counted by the number of encoded characters in a message. 
* Every API call (via the connector or API) to Anypoint MQ counts as one API request.
+
All requests to the broker API, such as sending, receiving, and acknowledging messages,
and all operations on queues and exchanges, are counted against the quota.

* Up to 10 messages can be retrieved from a single API call, which only bills as one request.
+
Even if the request to retrieve messages does not return a message (for example, if the queue is empty),
it bills as a single API request.
* If a message sent to the DLQ is a dead letter from another queue, the message is not charged against the billable API requests.
+
However, if a client sends a message directly to a DLQ, that message is charged.
* Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.
