You can view a chart indicating how much data and how many API requests have been consumed, and how many message units were received.


API requests::
API requests are used to calculate your monthly quota for billing.
+
** Every API call (via the connector or API) to Anypoint MQ counts as one API request.
+
include::partial$mq-faq.adoc[tag=apiRequests]
** You can retrieve up to 10 messages from a single API call, which only bills as one request.
+
Even if the request to retrieve messages does not return a message (for example, if the queue is empty),
it bills as a single API request.
** If a queue sends a message to a DLQ, the message is not charged against the billable API requests.
+
However, if a client sends a message directly to a DLQ, that request is charged.

Message units::
Message units are not used for billing.
+
** Each message unit contains 100 KB of data.
+
** Message units are counted by the number of encoded characters in a message. 


Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.
