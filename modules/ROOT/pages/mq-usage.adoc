= Viewing Usage Graphs

You can view a chart indicating how much data and how many API requests have been consumed, and how many message units were received.

[[api-requests]]
API requests::
API requests are used to calculate your monthly quota for billing.
+
** Every API call (via the connector or API) to Anypoint MQ counts as one API request.
+
include::partial$mq-faq.adoc[tag=apiRequests]
+
include::partial$mq-faq.adoc[tag=apiStatsRequests]
+
** You can retrieve up to 10 messages from a single API call, which only bills as one request.
+
Even if the request to retrieve messages does not return a message (for example, if the queue is empty),
it bills as a single API request.
** If a queue sends a message to a DLQ, the message is not charged against the billable API requests.
+
However, if a client sends a message directly to a DLQ, that request is charged.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling failover for a queue can result in increased API requests because Anypoint MQ Connector periodically checks the fallback queue for messages to consume. 
For more information, see
xref:anypoint-mq-connector::anypoint-mq-failover.adoc#configure-check-frequency[Configure the Frequency of Fallback Queue Checks].
====

Message units::
Message units are not used for billing.
+
Message units are used by Anypoint MQ to determine the size of message data in the response.
+
** Each message unit contains 100 KB of data.
** Message units are counted by the number of encoded characters in a message. 


Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.

== Access Anypoint MQ Usage

To view Anypoint MQ usage:

. In Anypoint Platform, go to *Access Management*.
. Click *MQ* in the *Subscription* section:
+
image::mq-access-mgmt-subscription.png["MQ option on the Access Management page"]
+
The chart shows usage stats for the current and previous month:
+
image::mq-usage-chart.png["MQ Usage page, including message units and API requests"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. The percentage and amount of your license limits that you have used.
+
If the usage for either API requests or message units is 0, the chart displays `<1%`.
+
The circle graph changes to red as your usage approaches your license limits:
+
image::mq-msg-unit-color.png["Circle graph indicating license limit"]
.. Subscription type
+
`Base 0.0` indicates the Base subscription.
+
Base values greater than `0.0` indicate Premium add-on subscriptions.

In some cases, the stats for the current month might not load when the backend process updates the records.
If this happens, use the Anypoint MQ Stats API xref:mq-apis.adoc#usage-by-org[Usage Metrics by Organization] to query the daily usage in the current month and then add the daily usage together.
