A _queue_ is a temporary storage area for a message. You can create queues, FIFO queues, and dead-letter queues in Anypoint Platform. You can also send and receive messages from a queue in Anypoint Studio.

Using Anypoint MQ, you can create two types of queues: 

* Standard queue
+
These queues don't guarantee a specific message order. Standard queues are the best fit for applications in which messages must be delivered quickly.
+
Anypoint MQ supports up to 120,000 in-flight messages per standard queue.
+
Standard queues provide "at least once" message-delivery reliability.
Anypoint MQ can deliver each message to more than one consumer.
Because the architecture is highly distributed, Anypoint MQ occasionally delivers messages more than once.
* FIFO (first in, first out) queue
+
These queues ensure that your messages arrive in order. FIFO queues are the best fit for applications requiring strict message ordering and exactly-once delivery, but in which message delivery speed is of less importance. See <<FIFO Queues>>.
+
Anypoint MQ supports 10 in-flight messages per message group in a FIFO queue.
//Shared Message Group Limits
include::partial$mq-faq.adoc[tag=messageGroupLimit]
+
FIFO queues provide "exactly once" message-delivery reliability.
Anypoint MQ delivers each message to only one consumer.

You can assign either standard or FIFO queue type as a dead-letter queue (DLQ). See <<Dead Letter Queues>>.

Standard queues can be bound to a xref:mq-exchanges.adoc[_message exchange_], enabling you to send messages to multiple queues.

You can filter queues by type in the *Destinations* page:

.The arrow shows the filters at the top of the *Destinations* page.
image::mq-filters.png[Filters at the top of the Destinations page]


== Prerequisites

You must create an environment, user access, and roles for accessing Anypoint MQ before configuring queues. See xref:mq-access-management.adoc[Configure Environment, User, and Role Access].


== Create a Queue

To create a standard queue or FIFO queue:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus icon (+) to display the menu:
+
.The arrow shows the blue plus icon at the top of the *Destinations* page.
image::mq-blue-create.png[Blue plus icon used for adding a queue]
+
. Select *Queue* or *FIFO Queue*.
+
For *Exchange*, see xref:mq-exchanges.adoc[Configure Message Exchanges].
. Complete the fields in *Create Queue* or *Create FIFO Queue*:
+
.The screenshot shows the *Create Queue* popup.
image::mq-create-queues.png[Create Queue popup]
+
--
** *ID* specifies the queue name.
+
Queue names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), periods (.), and hyphens (-). They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
+
** *Message TTL* (Time-to-live) specifies how long unprocessed messages persist before being deleted. 
+
The maximum TTL for a message is two weeks.
** *Default Acknowledgment Timeout* specifies how long a message waits before being put back into the queue in the event of server failure when the message is not acknowledged.
+
The lock makes the message unavailable to other apps while locked, but does not block other messages from being read.
+
The maximum acknowledgement timeout is 12 hours.
** *Assign Default Delivery Delay* specifies how long to delay delivery for messages sent to the queue.
+
You can specify to delay message delivery in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. When you send a message, you can override the default delivery delay. See xref:mq-understanding.adoc#delay_queues[Delay queues].
** *Encryption* encrypts all messages in the queue. 
+
See xref:mq-understanding.adoc#encrypt-queue[Encrypted queues].
** *Assign a Dead Letter Queue* assigns the DLQ.
+
The DLQ is a previously created queue to which to send undeliverable messages. See <<Dead Letter Queues>>.
--

. Click *Create Queue*.
+ 
The queue is created and appears in the *Destinations* page:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the ID, (*2*) the type, and (*3*) the details label for the queue in the *Destinations* page.

+
** *Payload* contains the message payload text, such as `Hello Mules!`.
** *Delivery Delay* (standard queue only) indicates the time to delay the message delivery (optional). 
+
If you specified *Assign Default Delivery Delay* on the standard queue, you see the default delivery delay. You can override that value for this message or set a delivery delay for a message in a queue without delivery delay. 
+
Delayed delivery is not supported for individual messages in a FIFO queue.
+
See xref:mq-understanding.adoc#delay_messages[Delayed delivery for messages].
+
** *Message Group ID* (FIFO queue only) specifies the group to which the message belongs.
+
To preserve message order for an app, you might want to create a message group for each application to send messages:
+
.The arrow shows the *Message Group ID* field in the *Message Sender* page.
image::mq-fifo-msg-groups.png[Message Group ID field for FIFO queues in the Message Sender page]
+
include::partial$mq-msg-group-id.adoc[]
+
See <<FIFO Queues and Message Groups>>.
** *Add User Properties* configures user properties to send with the message.
+
Toggle *Add User Properties* and specify the property name-value pairs to send:
+
.The arrow shows the *Add User Properties* toggle in the *Message Sender* page.

== Get a Message from a Queue

You can verify that a message arrived by retrieving it from the queue.

To get a message from a queue:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the left pane.
. Click the queue ID to display the *Queue Settings* page.
. In the settings page, click *Message Browser* in the left pane:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Message Browser* option and (*2*) the *Get Messages* button.
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png[Message Browser option and Get Messages button]
. Specify the number of messages (1-500) to retrieve and the time to poll (1-3600 seconds).
+
The specified number is the minimum number of messages to retrieve.
+
For a FIFO queue, you can retrieve up to 10 messages.
. If you are retrieving messages from a FIFO queue, select the checkbox to acknowledge 
that viewing messages through the browser might cause other consumers of the queue to be blocked from accessing messages in the queue:
+
.The arrow shows the accept checkbox for getting messages from a FIFO queue.
image::mq-fifo-msg-browser.png[Accept checkbox for FIFO queues]
. Click *Get Messages*.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the message row, (*2*) the message payload in the details pane, (*3*) the *Return Messages* icon, (*4*) the *Delete* icon, (*5*) the *Full Screen* icon, (*6*) the close details pane icon (*X*), and (*7*) the user properties.
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png[Selected message row, payload in the details pane, and Return Messages, Delete, Full Screen, and close details pane (X) icons]
+
* Click *Full Screen* to display the message payload in a separate window.
* Click *X* to close the details pane.
* Click *Delete* to delete the selected message.
+
Deleting a message is an acknowledgment operation (ACK). For information about how Anypoint MQ processes ACK messages, see xref:mq-ack-mode.adoc[Acknowledge Messages].
* Click *Return Messages* to return all messages to the queue (for example, to enable other applications to read the messages). 
+
Returning messages to the queue is a not-acknowledgment operation (NACK). The messages aren't altered. However, the time-to-live (TTL) value you set when you created the queue determines how long the message is available before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
If you switch from the *Message Browser* page, messages automatically return to the queue.
+

== FIFO Queues

For applications where the order of messages must be strictly preserved and enforced, Anypoint MQ provides first in, first out (FIFO) processing to enable message ordering. With FIFO queues, Anypoint MQ ensures that the order in which messages are placed in a queue is the same order messages are retrieved.

FIFO queues have the following benefits and restrictions:

* Are limited to 300 TPS (transactions per second) 
+
However, if you batch 10 messages per each read and write operation (maximum) using the API, FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 TPS.
* Support delivery delay on all messages in the FIFO queue
+
If you change the delivery delay for a FIFO queue, the setting change is retroactive to all messages in the queue. Delayed delivery is not supported for individual messages in a FIFO queue. 
* Support multiple <<FIFO Queues and Message Groups,message groups>> 
* Provide  encryption
+
Encrypting a FIFO queue does not affect the order or the contents of messages consumed.
* Can be used as a DLQ
+
When assigning a DLQ to a FIFO queue, the DLQ must also be a FIFO queue.
* Cannot be bound to a message exchange
* Should not be used with `prefetch` mode.

To create a FIFO queue, see <<Create a Queue>>. To determine if a queue is FIFO or standard (non-FIFO), view its details. 

See the xref:mq-faq#regions[Anypoint MQ FAQ] for the regions in which Anypoint MQ and FIFO queues are available.

For information about creating FIFO queues with the Admin API, see xref:mq-apis.adoc#create-a-fifo-queue-in-the-admin-api-portal[Create a FIFO Queue in the Admin API Portal].

=== FIFO Queues and Message Groups

Message groups enable multiple consumers to access messages in a FIFO queue.
Only one consumer at a time can access messages in a message group.
When a consumer is accessing a message group, other message groups in the FIFO queue are available to other consumers, reducing the chance that the FIFO queue is blocked.

//Shared Message Group Limits
include::partial$mq-faq.adoc[tag=messageGroupLimit]

The FIFO queue processes messages in the message group one by one, in the order they were added.
If the queue includes multiple message group IDs, it returns as many messages with the same message group ID as possible.

[NOTE]
FIFO queues do not support retrieving messages by message group ID.

If a message doesn't have an associated message group ID, the message is assigned to a default message group. If you require a single group of ordered messages, provide the same message group ID for messages sent to the FIFO queue.

Message order is preserved within the message group, but is not enforced across message groups.
If multiple applications send messages associated with the same message group ID to a FIFO queue,
the messages are stored in the order they arrive.
To preserve message order for an app, make sure that each app uses a specific message group ID to send messages.

==== Process Messages in Message Groups in Order 

If a message in a message group is not acknowledged, it returns to the queue 
and Anypoint MQ continues processing the next message in the group.
This behavior might not be desirable if a message in the group depends on a previous message.

To ensure that the FIFO queue processes the messages in order:

. Set the value of `maxConcurrency` on the flow to `1`, which forces the flow to process requests individually.
. Set `subscriber-type` to `polling`, which controls message consumption.
. Set the value of `fetchSize` to `1`, which ensures that only one message is buffered.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
...
<flow name="myFlow" doc:id="doc_ID" maxConcurrency="1">
  <anypoint-mq:subscriber doc:name="Subscriber" doc:id="doc_ID" config-ref="Anypoint_MQ_Config" destination="myQueue">
    <anypoint-mq:subscriber-type >
      <anypoint-mq:polling fetchSize="1" >
...
----

==== Use Message Groups to Process Messages in Parallel

Anypoint MQ automatically processes messages from different message groups in parallel, 
maintaining the relative order of messages in the message groups.

To process messages in message groups in parallel,
and preserve the order of messages within the groups,
configure multiple Subscriber flows in the app,
each with the value of `maxConcurrency` set to `1`.

==== Assign a Message Group ID to a Message

To assign a message group ID to a message:

. <<Send a Message to a Queue,Send a message to a queue>>.
. In the *Message Sender* page, specify the message group to which the message belongs:
+
.The arrow shows the *Message Group ID* field in the *Message Sender* page.
image::mq-fifo-msg-groups.png[Message Group ID field for FIFO queues in the Message Sender page]



==== Determine the Message Group to Which a Message Belongs

To see which message group a message belongs to:

. <<Get a Message from a Queue,Get a message from the queue>>.
. In the *Message Browser*, check the details pane for the message: 
+
.The arrow shows the *Message Group ID* value in the details pane for a message in the queue.
image::mq-fifo-msg-group-id.png[Message Group ID value in the details pane for a message]


=== FIFO Exactly-Once Delivery

For applications in which messages must be processed exactly once, such as those used in transactional use cases, FIFO queues ensure exactly-once message delivery.

FIFO queues provide message deduplication. If multiple messages are sent to a FIFO queue containing the same message ID, the first message to arrive is kept as the valid message. Subsequent messages within the deduplication interval of five minutes are considered duplicates and are discarded. For example, after the queue sees that a message with ID `12345` arrives in the queue, for the next five minutes, the FIFO queue discards any messages with the ID `12345`.

When building applications in Anypoint Studio that require exactly-once delivery, you can either:

* Set the message ID in the publisher settings in the Anypoint MQ connector.
* Let Anypoint MQ autogenerate a unique message ID for each message sent to a queue (default).

== Dead Letter Queues

Anypoint MQ enables you to ensure that messages that aren't delivered are sent to a queue known as the dead-letter queue (DLQ). You can then analyze the messages sent to the DLQ to determine why those messages were not delivered. 

A DLQ is essentially the same as any other queue except that it receives only undelivered messages. You can specify the time-to-live (TTL) value, encryption, and delivery delay when you create the queue. 

You must have at least two queues for one of them to be assigned as a DLQ. Both queues must be:

* The same type (standard or FIFO)
* In the same geographical xref:mq-faq.adoc#regions[region]
* In the same environment and owned by the same Anypoint Platform account.

=== Encryption

Undeliverable messages that are sent to the DLQ use the encryption set for the source queue, regardless of the DLQ encryption setting. Messages that are sent directly to the DLQ by a client use the encryption setting for the DLQ. If your organization's policy is that all messages are encrypted, then you must set encryption for all queues.

=== Billing and Maximum Deliveries

If a message sent to the DLQ is a dead letter from another queue, the message is not charged against the billable API requests.
However, if a client sends a message directly to a DLQ, that message is charged.

If a queue has a dead-letter queue assigned:

* Viewing the messages in the source queue using the Anypoint MQ *Message Browser* counts against the number of maximum deliveries.
* Viewing a message and returning it to the queue counts as a NACK operation and is considered an unsuccessful delivery attempt.
* Deleting the message in the *Message Browser* prevents it from being counted against the maximum deliveries, but the message is lost.

=== How Messages Are Sent to a DLQ

This flowchart shows how messages are sent to a DLQ:

image::mq-dlq-flowchart.png[]

=== Assign a DLQ to a Queue

You can assign any queue as a DLQ for another queue as long as it's the same type and in the same region and environment. 

* Messages sent to a FIFO DLQ must originate from a FIFO queue. 
* Messages sent to a standard DLQ must originate from a standard queue.
+ 
See <<fifoqueues,FIFO Queues>>.

To assign a DLQ to a queue:

. <<Create a Queue,Create a queue>>. 
. Toggle *Assign a Dead Letter Queue* to *On*.
+
The following additional fields appear:
+
.The screenshot shows the DLQ fields in the *Create Queue* page.
image::mq-create-q-dlq.png[DLQ fields in the Create Queue page]


* *Dead Letter Queue Name* 
+
Choose a previously created queue name from the drop-down list.
* *Reroute after 10 attempts* (Optional)
+
Specify how many times Anypoint MQ attempts to deliver messages in the queue before rerouting the message to the dead-letter queue. If not specified, the default value is 10 tries. This value ranges from 1 to 1000 attempts.

=== Recover Messages from a DLQ

You can recover messages from the DLQ using the REST API to get the message from the queue and writing the message to a new queue. See xref:mq-apis.adoc#mqadminapi[Anypoint MQ Admin API].

=== Determine Whether a Queue is a DLQ

You can see whether a queue is a DLQ by viewing its details:

.The screenshot shows the DLQ status in the details pane for the queue.
image::mq-queue-view-dlq.png[DLQ status in the details pane]

You can also view details of each queue from the REST Administration API, using the Get Queue REST endpoint. 

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
 "encrypted": false,
 "type": "queue",
 "queueId": "my-dlq-1",
 "deadLetterSources": [
   "my-queue-4",
   "my-dls-1"
 ],
 "defaultTtl": 2000000,
 "defaultLockTtl": 2000000
}
----

If DLQ is set, the returned entities contain the `deadLetterSources` field.
