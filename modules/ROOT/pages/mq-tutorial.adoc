= Tutorial: Create a Queue and Send Messages to It

Use this tutorial to get started with using Anypoint MQ to send messages to and retrieve messages from a _queue_, which is a temporary storage area for a message. 

In this tutorial, you:

. Create a queue in Anypoint MQ.
. Send messages to the queue, verify that they arrived, and view the message payload.
. Configure a connected app and use the ID and secret to configure Anypoint Connector for MQ (Anypoint MQ Connector) version 4.x.
+
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion]
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion3x]
. Create an app in Design Center, configure Anypoint MQ Connector, and test the connection.
. Create a Mule 4.x app in Anypoint Studio 7.x, configure Anypoint MQ Connector, and test the connection.
. Optionally, create a Mule 3.9 app in Anypoint Studio 6, configure Anypoint MQ Connector for Mule 3, and test the connection.

== Before You Begin

* Familiarity with xref:mq-glossary.adoc[]
* An https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform account^]
* An Enterprise license
+
Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your system
* A https://curl.haxx.se[`curl` command line tool^] for testing 
+
This tutorial uses the HTTP Listener trigger to initiate Anypoint MQ Connector access and a `curl` command to submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API.

== Step 1. Create a Queue

First, you create a queue, send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

To create a queue:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. If you want to test the queue in Anypoint Studio 7, switch to any environment except Design. 
+
For example, click the environment button and select *Production*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-switch-env.png["Environment button"]
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-destinations-option.png["Destinations option and the Add icon"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. *Destinations* navigation menu displays available queues.
.. *Add* icon creates a new queue or exchange.
. Click the *Add* icon (image:icon-blue-plus.png["Add icon in Destinations",2.5%,2.5%]) to display the menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-create-choices.png["Add icon menu options"]
. Select *Queue*.
. [[create-demo-queue]] In the *Create Queue* window, enter `myDemoQueue` in the *ID* field:
+
image::mq-create-queues.png["Create Queue window"]
+
Queue names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (. -) characters. They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
. If you want, specify any other queue settings. 
+
For information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#create-a-queue[Create a Queue].
. Click *Create Queue*.
+ 
Anypoint MQ creates the queue in the *Destinations* page:
+
image::mq-tutorial-queue-details.png["Destinations page with the new queue"]

You have successfully created a queue. Next, you send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

== Step 2. Send Messages to a Queue and Verify That They Arrived

After you create the queue, you test the queue sending messages to it, validating that the messages arrived in the queue, and retrieving them from the queue.

To send and receive messages from a queue:

. In the *Destinations* page, click `myDemoQueue`.
. Click *Message Sender* in the navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-page.png["Message Sender navigation menu"]
. Leave the *Type* field set to *Text* and enter `Hello Mules!` in the *Payload* field.
. If you want, toggle *Add User Properties*, specify the property name-value pairs to send, and click *Add Property*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-user-props.png["Add User Properties toggle in the Message Sender page"]
+
include::partial$mq-user-props.adoc[tag=mquserpropsTypeColor]
. Click *Send*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*, enter the following in the *Payload* field, and click *Send*:
+
[source,csv,linenums]
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*, enter the following in the *Payload* field, and click *Send*:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
Next, verify that the messages arrived in the queue.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue type for `myDemoQueue` to display its details.
+
The details pane shows the number of messages in the queue:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msgs-in-queue.png["Three messages in the myDemoQueue queue in the details pane"]
. In the details pane, click the queue details label `myDemoQueue`.
. Click *Message Browser* in the navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png["Message Browser in the navigation menu"]
. Enter `5` for the number of messages to retrieve and `10` for the number of seconds to poll.
+
You can retrieve between 1-500 messages and poll for between 1-3600 seconds.
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
Anypoint MQ retrieves the messages from the queue and displays them in the Message Browser.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png["Selected message row and the payload in the details pane"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Selected message.
.. Message payload in the details pane.


You have successfully created a queue in Anypoint MQ, sent messages to the queue, verified that the messages arrived, and viewed the message payload. Next, you create a connected app to connect a Mule app to Anypoint MQ.


[[configure-connected-app]]
== Step 3. Configure a Connected App

After you test the queue, you configure a connected app, which generates the ID and secret you use to configure Anypoint MQ Connector.

[NOTE]
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion]
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion3x]

include::partial$mq-shared-connect-apps.adoc[tags=!ScopesConnApp]

You have successfully configured a connected app. Next, you create a Mule app in Design Center and connect it to Anypoint MQ.


[[configure-design-center]]
== Step 4. Create and Connect a Mule App to Anypoint MQ in Design Center

After you configure the connected app, you use Design Center to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ, submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API, and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.


=== Before You Begin

* Disable password programs such as LastPass or Okta in your browser before using Design Center.
+
If enabled, the password program inserts passwords in fields in Design Center, which can cause the app to fail. 
* Leave the Anypoint Platform window open so that you can access the destination URL and the ID and secret values for the connected app.

=== Configure an App with Anypoint MQ in Design Center

To configure an app in Design Center:

. In *Anypoint Platform*, click *Design Center* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Create new* > *New Mule App* to create a new integration flow.
. In the *New Mule App* window, enter `mqdemo` for the project name and click *Create App*.
. In the help wizard, click *Go straight to canvas*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-goto-canvas.png["Go straight to canvas link"]
. Click the *Trigger* box and enter `H` to search for the HTTP Listener:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-http-search.png["Search for the HTTP Listener"]
. Click *HTTP Listener*.
. In the *HTTP Listener* window, set the value of *Path* to `/mq/{messageId}` and then click the *Close* icon (image:icon-ds-close.png["Close icon",2.5%,2.5%]):
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-http-path.png["Path value and Close button"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. *Path* field specifies the path to the message ID.
.. *Close* icon closes the *HTTP Listener* window.

. Click the *Add* icon (image:icon-ds-plus.png["Add icon",2.5%,2.5%]) for the HTTP Listener trigger:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-plus-icon.png["Add icon"]
. In the *Select a component* window, enter `anypoint mq` to search for the Anypoint MQ Connector:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-mq-search.png["Search for the Anypoint MQ Connector"]
. Click the connector name, and then click the *Publish* operation:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-publish-select.png["Publish operation"]
+
For the other operations:
+
* To construct your Mule app to receive a message sent from a queue, use the *Consume* operation. 
* If your app has tests to determine if message processing succeeded, use the *Ack* operation  
to acknowledge that a message was received and can be deleted.
* If message processing failed, use the *Nack* operation to negatively acknowledge the message and return the message to the queue to be accessed again. 
. In the *Configuration* page, click *Add Connection*.
. In the *Configure Connection* page, specify `myDemoQueue` in the *Connection Name* field and select *Connection* as the connection type.
. Return to your *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* browser window to copy the URL, app ID, and secret values:
+
.. Click *Destinations* in the navigation menu.
.. [[copy-url]] Click *Copy* and select *Connector version 4.x and later* from the menu to copy the URL:
+
image::mq-tutorial-url.png["Copy button in the Destinations page"]
+
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion3x]
.. In the *Configure Connection* page in Design Center, paste the copied URL in the *URL* field.
.. Return to the <<connected-apps-window,Connected Apps>> window and copy the ID and secret for the connected app.
.. Paste the ID and secret values to the *Configure Connection* page in Design Center:
+
--
image::mq-tutorial-dc-client-id-secret.png["Client App ID field and Client Secret field in the Configure Connection page"]
--
. Click *Test* to ensure that you have access to your app:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-test-connection.png["Success box"]
+
* If successful, the green *Success* box appears.
* If unsuccessful, ensure that the URL, ID, and secret values are correct.
+
If the URL does not match the URL in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*, copy the <<copy-url,URL>> from Anypoint MQ to the Design Center window and click *Test* again.

. Click *Save* twice.
. In the *Publish Configuration* page, enter `myDemoQueue`.
+
This name is the <<create-demo-queue,queue name>> that you created earlier in this tutorial.
. Click the *Close* icon (image:icon-ds-close.png["Close icon",2.5%,2.5%]) to close the *Publish Configuration* page:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-mq-close.png["Close icon"]
. Select *Deploy Application* from the image:icon-ds-v.png["V icon",2.5%,2.5%] menu: 
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-deploy-option.png["Deploy Application menu option in Design Center"]
. In the *Deploy Mule application* window, select the target environment and application name, and then click *Deploy*.
+
After the app deploys successfully, you can click in the *Deployment success* popup to view the app in Runtime Manager.

You have successfully used Design Center to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ. Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and using Anypoint MQ to view the results.

=== Test Your Design Center App

After you create your app in Design Center, you test your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.

To test your app:

. In Design Center, click the project type for your app to display the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-deploy-url.png["Deployment URL in details pane"]
. Copy the value of *Deployment url*.
. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt to send the `body` value as an Anypoint MQ message. 
+
Replace _DEPLOYMENT-URL_ with the deployment URL from Design Center. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://DEPLOYMENT-URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Welcome to MuleSoft!"
  }
]'
----
+
The `100` value in the URL is the message ID value as specified by the `/mq/{messageId}` value in the HTTP Listener, which is the identifier for your message.
+
Next, you verify that the message arrived in the queue.
. Select *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* > *Destinations*.
. Click the name of the <<create-demo-queue,`myDemoQueue`>> queue that you created earlier and specified in the *Destination* setting for your app in Design Center.
. Click *Message Browser* in the navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png["Message Browser in the navigation menu"]
. Enter `5` for the number of messages to retrieve and `10` for the number of seconds to poll.
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
Anypoint MQ retrieves the messages from the queue and displays them in the Message Browser.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png["Selected message row and the payload in the details pane"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Selected message.
.. Message payload in the details pane.
. Try changing the body text in the `curl` command and repeat the steps to view the message.

You have successfully tested your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and using Anypoint MQ to view the results. Next, you create a Mule app in Anypoint Studio 7 and connect it to Anypoint MQ.

[[configure-mule-4-studio]]
== Step 5. Create and Connect a Mule 4 App to Anypoint MQ in Anypoint Studio 7

You can now use Anypoint Studio 7 to create a Mule 4 app similar to the app you created in Design Center. In Studio 7, you can deploy the app to CloudHub and submit a `curl` command to test the connection.
