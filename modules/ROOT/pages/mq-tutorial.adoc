= Tutorial: Create a Queue and Message Exchange
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This tutorial helps you send and receive messages using Anypoint MQ using a 
publish/subscribe queue mechanism. Anypoint MQ provides a user interface built into
Anypoint Platform that lets you send messages to a queue or message exchange, 
and then read the messages from a queue. Anypoint MQ also provides a connector 
that works with Anypoint Studio. See xref:mq-connectors.adoc[MQ Connectors] for 
more information.

== Prerequisites

. Read xref:mq-understanding.adoc[MQ Terminology].
. Create an Anypoint Platform account to configure an environment, user permissions, register applications in MQ, and to create queues and message exchanges. You can access Anypoint MQ in the Anypoint Platform and the left navigation bar.
. An Enterprise license is required to use MQ. Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
. Download and install Anypoint Studio.
. You need a https://curl.haxx.se[curl command] to test MQ in this tutorial. 

Queue and message exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Queue and message exchange names are limited to 127 characters in length.

== Create a Queue

A queue provides a temporary area for holding messages. Applications
push messages to the queue, and other applications consume
the messages. In Anypoint MQ, you can read messages, return the messages
for later viewing, or delete a message. By default, messages return to the
waiting area so that other applications can read them. Messages persist until the
time to live (TTL) value expires. By default, a message persists in Anypoint MQ
for up to 7 days. The minimum message TTL is 1 minute and the maximum is 14 days.

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations:
+
image::mq-destinations-option.png[]
+
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[]
. In the drop-down, click *Queue*:
+
image::mq-create-choices.png[]
+
image::mq-create-demo-queue.png[]
+
. In the Create Queue screen, specify a name for the queue. This tutorial uses the `MyDemoQueue` value. 
+
The TTL is the time to live, that is, how long a message can stay in a queue before being deleted. The default lock TTL determines how long a message is unavailable to other applications. A locked message does not block other messages from being read.
. When done, click *Save Changes*:
+
The queue creates and you are returned to the *Destinations* screen.

*Note*: Where you click on a queue entry in the Destinations screen governs
what you see next:

image::mq-entryui.png[]

*Note:* If you need to delete a queue, see xref:mq-faq.adoc#how-do-i-delete-a-queue[How do I delete a queue?] in the xref:mq-faq.adoc[MQ FAQ].

== Send a Message to a Queue

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the MyDemoQueue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.
. Click the left side of the queue entry to open the Messaging feature, or click the right side of the queue entry and click the arrow to the right of the queue name:
+
image::mq-access-messaging2.png[]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender*:
+
image::mq-click-msg-sender2.png[]
+
. Type text in the Payload such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+
image::mq-msg-sender-text-payload2.png[]
+
. Click *Send*.

== Verify the Message in a Queue

. Click Destinations.
. Click the right side of the queue entry to view details and see the number of messages in the queue:
+
image::mq-num-queued-msgs.png[]

== Get a Message From a Queue

. In Anypoint Platform > MQ, click *Message Browser*:
+
image::mq-click-msg-browser2.png[]
+
. Click Get Messages.
+
image::mq-get-messages2.png[]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image::mq-click-id2.png[]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, so other applications can read
the message, click the Return Messages icon - this is the default condition. 
If you switch screens back to the Message Sender or to Destinations, messages 
automatically return to the queue. In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the 
queue is known as `nack` - the message is not altered. However, the time to 
live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue determines how long the 
message is available before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
image::mq-click-retmsgs2.png[]
+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. Anypoint MQ provides three modes for how messages delete after they are viewed. For more information, see xref:mq-ack-mode.adoc[Acknowledge a Message].
+
image::mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2.png[]

Now you are able to send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ. In the next section, you can try
alternate ways of formatting messages.

== Send a CSV or JSON Message

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message:
+
image::mq-json-get-msg2.png[]

To send a CSV message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
+
. Click Message Browser and the message ID to view the message.

== Register a Client Application

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Client App:
+
image::mq-click-client-apps.png[]
+
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[]
. Specify an application name such as `DemoClientApp` and click Save Changes.
+
image::mq-create-client-app-name.png[]
+
. Leave the Client Apps window open as you need to copy and
paste the Client ID and Client Secret
into the configuration for Anypoint Studio.

== Configure MQ in Design Center

IMPORTANT: Disable password programs such as LastPass or Okta in your browser before using Design Center. Otherwise, the password program inserts passwords in the HTTP Listener's TLS tab. The passwords in the TLS tab cause the app to fail. 

Before starting to configure an application in Design Center, leave a window open to Anypoint 
Platform > MQ. Determine the queue you want to access and have a client application available to get its client ID and secret from.

. In Anypoint Platform > Design Center, click Create > Mule Application:
+
image::mq-dc-create.png[]
+
. Provide a project name and click Create. In this tutorial, the app is called `mqdemo`:
+
image::mq-dc-new-mule-app.png[]
+
. In the help wizard, click *Go straight to Canvas*.
+
image::mq-dc-go-straight.png[]
+
. Select a trigger for the action that starts the MQ connector access. The 
simplest is to use an HTTP Listener, which we use in this tutorial to initiate access using the curl command. Alternatively you can use MQ as a Subscriber to retrieve messages from a destination name, or specify a Scheduler to accept input at prescribed times.
+
Type in a few letters in the trigger search box, such as "HT" and select the HTTP Listener:
+
image::mq-dc-http-find.png[]
+
. In the HTTP Listener, set the Path to the `/mq/{messageId}` value.
+
image::mq-dc-http-path.png[]
+
. Click the plus symbol to the right of the trigger:
+
image::mq-dc-click-plus.png[]
+
. In the Component menu, select the Mule Anypoint MQ Connector.
. For this tutorial, select the Publish operation:
+
image::mq-dc-publish-op.png[]
+
For the other operations, if you were constructing your application to receive a message sent from a queue, you would use the Consume operation. If your application had tests to determine if message processing succeeded, you would use the Ack operation  
to acknowledge that a message was received and could be deleted. Similarly if message 
processing failed, you would use the Nack operation to negatively acknowledge the message. In the case of Nack, the message would be returned to the queue to await accessing.
+ 
. In the *Destination*, specify the name of queue you want to access from your Anypoint Platform > MQ window, such as the MyDemoQueue that was created earlier in this tutorial. Then click
*Set Up*.
+
image::mq-dc-destination.png[]
+
. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from your Anypoint Platform > MQ window. In the MQ 
window, click Client Apps and click the name of an application. Click Copy for each ID and 
secret values and paste each in the Design Center window.
+
image::mq-dc-client-id-secret.png[]
+
. Click *Test* to ensure that you have access to your MQ app. If successful,
the green Test Successful box appears. If not, ensure that the client ID, client secret,
and URL values are correct. If the URL does not match that in Anypoint Platform > MQ, copy
the URL from MQ to the Design Center screen and try the Test again.
+
image::mq-dc-test-connection.png[]
+
. Click the Run button. 
+
image::mq-dc-run-btn.png[]
+
image::mq-dc-running.png[]

=== Test Your Design Center App

. Run this command from a command prompt to send the "body" value as an MQ message. The "100" value in the URL 
specifies the message ID value per the `/mq{messageId}` value in the HTTP Listener, which is the identifier for your message:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://DEPLOYMENT_URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Welcome to MuleSoft!"
  }
]'
----
+
You can find the value for DEPLOYMENT_URL in the detail for your application in Design Center window:
+
image::mq-dc-details.png[]
+
. In Anypoint Platform > MQ, click the name of the queue you specified as the Destination in Design Center. Click *Message Browser*:
+
image::mq-msg-browser.png[]
+
. Click *Get Messages*:
+
image::mq-get-messages.png[]
+
. Click the ID value in the message page to view the message contents:
+
image::mp-dc-test-in-mq.png[]
+
. Try changing the body text in the curl command and repeating the steps to view the message.

You can now configure MQ in Design Center, submit REST API commands to the MQ Broker API, 
and use MQ to view the results.


== Create a Studio 7 Application

You can use Anypoint Studio 7 to create an MQ application much the same way as you
created in Design Center. Studio 7 enables you to create the application, 
you can test the program, and then package the application into a zip file to 
put into Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager. Runtime Manager serves the application so
you can submit curl commands as you did in the previous <<Configure MQ in Design Center>> section. See xref:mq-connectors.adoc[MQ Connectors] for more information.

Prerequisites: 

* Studio 7 requires that you install https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle Java SDK 8]. Earlier versions of Java or versions after version 8 are not supported. 
* In Anypoint Platform, change the environment to *Production* and ensure that any 
values you set and get in Anypoint Platform > MQ are also in the Production environment.
* If you have not done so already, https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[download and install Anypoint Studio 7].

=== Configure Studio 7 for MQ

. Start Studio, click File > New > Mule Project, and give the the project a name such as `mq`.
. Click the Exchange icon in the toolbar:
+
image::mq-st7-exchange.png[]
+
. In Exchange, click Login and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the Anypoint MQ Connector, click *Add to project*, and click Proceed.
. Click HTTP in the Mule Palette:
+
image::mq-st7-mule-palette.png[]
+
. Click *Listener* and drag it to the Studio canvas.
. Click Anypoint MQ and drag *Publish* to the right of the Listener on the canvas:
+
image::mq-st7-flow.png[]
+
. Click the Listener icon. Set the General > Path to the `/mq/{messageId}` value:
+
image::mq-st7-listener-path.png[]
+
. Click the green plus button to the right of the *Connector configuration* field.
. Set the Host to 0.0.0.0 and the Port to 8081. Leave all other values as they are:
+
image::mq-st7-globals.png[]
+
. Click the MQ Publish icon. Set the Destination to the name of a queue in Anypoint Platform > MQ. Ensure that the queue is in the Production environment.
. Click the green plus button to the right of the *Connector configuration* field.
. Set the URL field to the URL in MQ:
+
image::mq-url.png[]
+
. In MQ, click Client Apps. If needed create a new app. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to the clipboard and paste each into Studio. Ensure that MQ is in the Production environment.
+
image::mq-st7-id-secret.png[]
+
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure the values are correct.
. Save your project. Right click the name of your app in Package Explorer and click
Anypoint Platform > Deploy to CloudHub.
+
image::mq-st7-deploy.png[]
+
If you see this message: "You do not have permission to deploy new applications in this environment. Please select an existing application to redeploy" -- Change the environment so that environment is *not* the Design environment, such as to set the environment to Production.
To change the environment, click the *Design* box in the upper left, and select another environment.
+
You may also need to change the name of the application to deploy it successfully.
+
. Browse to Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager. Ensure the application is running. Click
the application and copy the *App url* value:
+
image::mq-app-url.png[]
+
. In the following command, replace DEPLOYMENT_URL with the *App url* value from Runtime Manager. Run this command from a command prompt to send the "body" value as an MQ message. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://DEPLOYMENT_URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Message via Runtime Manager"
  }
]'
----
+
If you see a 404 message for Destination not found, verify that the name of the queue 
in the Studio 7 MQ Publish > Destination field matches the name of the queue in Anypoint Platform > MQ.
+
You can redeploy your application by right-clicking the project in Studio 7 and 
selecting Anypoint Platform > Deploy to CloudHub. This command lets you update the
app in Runtime Manager.
+
. In Anypoint Platform > MQ (in the Production environment), click the queue name, click
Message Browser, Get Messages, and click the message to view the content of the message:
+

== Create a Message Exchange

A message exchange groups one or more queues so that a message sent to the message exchange goes to all bound queues.

. Log into Anypoint Platform > MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[]
. Click Exchange.
. Specify the name `MyDemoExchange`.
. Click the checkbox to bind MyDemoQueue to this message exchange.
. Click Save Changes.
. In the Destinations screen, click the message exchange Type to list its details.

To delete a message exchange, see xref:mq-faq.adoc#how-do-i-delete-an-exchange[How do I delete a Message Exchange?] in the xref:mq-faq.adoc[Anypoint MQ FAQ].

== Bind a Queue to a Message Exchange

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the left side of the message exchange entry in Destinations.
+
*Note*: Where you click on a message exchange entry in the Destinations table governs
what you see next:
+
image::mq-where-to-click-x2.png[]
+
. In the message exchange menu, click Bind for each queue you want to bind to the message exchange:
+
image::mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2.png[]

== Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue.
The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange.

. Log into Anypoint Platform > MQ.
. Click Destinations.
. Click the `MessageExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the message exchange.
. Click the MessageExchange link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:
+
image::mq-exchange-msg-access2.png[]
+
. Click Message Sender:
+
image::mq-exchange-msg-sender2.png[]
+
. Type the contents of the Payload and click Send:
+
image::mq-exchange-payload2.png[]

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described
in <<Get a Message From a Queue>>.

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message Type value. For more information, see <<Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
