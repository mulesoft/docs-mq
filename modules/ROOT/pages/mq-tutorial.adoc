Use this tutorial to get started with using Anypoint MQ to send messages to and retrieve messages from a _queue_, which is a temporary storage area for a message. 

In this tutorial, you:

. Create a queue in Anypoint MQ.
. Send messages to the queue, verify that they arrived, and view the message payload.
. In Anypoint MQ, register a client app that you then use to configure Anypoint MQ Connector. 
. Create an app in Design Center, configure Anypoint MQ Connector, and test the connection.
. Create an app in Anypoint Studio, configure Anypoint MQ Connector, and test the connection.
+
Depending on your Mule version, you create your app in Studio 7 (Mule 4) or Studio 6 (Mule 3).

== Prerequisites

* Familiarity with xref:mq-understanding.adoc[Anypoint MQ terminology]
* An xref::anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform account]
* An Enterprise license
+
Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your system
* A https://curl.haxx.se[`curl` command] for testing 
+
This tutorial uses the HTTP Listener trigger to initiate Anypoint MQ Connector access and a `curl` command to submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API.

== Create a Queue

First, you create a queue, send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

To create a queue:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. If you want to test the queue in Anypoint Studio 7, switch to any environment except Design. 
+
For example, click the environment button and select *Production*:
+
.The arrow shows the environment button in the left pane.
image::mq-tutorial-switch-env.png[Environment button]
. Click *Destinations*:
+
.The screenshot  shows (*1*) the *Destinations* option and (*2*) the blue plus icon (+).
image::mq-tutorial-destinations-option.png[Destinations option and blue plus icon]
+
. Click the blue plus icon (+) to display the menu:
+
.The screenshot shows the blue plus icon menu.
image::mq-tutorial-create-choices.png[Blue plus icon choices]
. Select *Queue*.
. In the *Create Queue* window, enter `myDemoQueue` in the *ID* field:
+
.The screenshot shows the *Create Queue* window.
image::mq-create-queues.png[Create Queue window]
+
Queue names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), periods (.), and hyphens (-). They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
. If you want, specify any other queue settings. 
+
For information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#create-a-queue[Create a Queue].
. Click *Create Queue*.
+ 
The queue is created and appears in the *Destinations* page:
+
.The *Destinations* page shows (*1*) the type, (*2*) ID, and (*3*) details label for the queue.
image::mq-queue-details.png[Destinations page with new queue]
+
From this page, you can: 
+
* Click the queue type (*1*) for the new queue to display its details in the right pane.
* Click the queue ID (*2*) or details label (*3*) to display the *Queue Settings* page. 

You have successfully created a queue. Next, you send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

== Send Messages to a Queue and Verify That They Arrived

After you create the queue, you test the queue you created by sending messages to it, validating that the messages arrived in the queue, and retrieving them from the queue.

To send and receive messages from a queue:

. In the *Destinations* page, click `myDemoQueue` to display the *Queue Settings* page.
. Click *Message Sender* in the left pane:
+
.The arrow shows the *Message Sender* option in the left pane.
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-page.png[Message Sender option]
. Enter `Hello Mules!` in the *Payload* field.
+
Leave the *Type* field set to *Text*.
. If you want, toggle *Add User Properties* and specify the property name-value pairs to send:
+
.The arrow shows the *Add User Properties* toggle in the *Message Sender* page.
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-user-props.png[Add User Properties toggle in the Message Sender page]
+
include::partial$mq-user-props.adoc[tag=mquserprops]
. Click *Send*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
. Click *Send*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
. Click *Send*.
+
Next, you verify that the messages arrived in the queue.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue type for `myDemoQueue` to display its details in the right pane.
+
The details pane shows the number of messages in the queue:
+
.The arrow shows the three messages that you sent to the `myDemoQueue` queue in the details pane.
image::mq-tutorial-msgs-in-queue.png[Three messages in the myDemoQueue queue in the details pane]
. In the *Destinations* page, click `myDemoQueue`.
. In the *Queue Settings* page, click *Message Browser* in the left pane:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Message Browser* option and (*2*) the *Get Messages* button.
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png[Message Browser option and Get Messages button]
. Click *Get Messages*.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the message row, (*2*) the message payload in the details pane, (*3*) the *Return Messages* icon, (*4*) the *Delete* icon, (*5*) the *Full Screen* icon, (*6*) the close details pane icon (*X*), and (*7*) the user properties.
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png[Selected message row, payload in the details pane, and Return Messages, Delete, Full Screen, and close details pane (X) icons]
+
* Click *Full Screen* to display the message payload in a separate window.
* Click *X* to close the details pane.
* Click *Delete* to delete the selected message.
+
Deleting a message is an acknowledgment operation (ACK). For information about how Anypoint MQ processes ACK messages, see xref:mq-ack-mode.adoc[Acknowledge Messages].
* Click *Return Messages* to return all messages to the queue (for example, to enable other applications to read the messages). 
+
Returning messages to the queue is a not-acknowledgment operation (NACK). The messages aren't altered. However, the time-to-live (TTL) value you set when you created the queue determines how long the message is available before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
If you switch from the *Message Browser* page, messages automatically return to the queue.

You have successfully created a queue in Anypoint MQ, sent messages to the queue, verified that the messages arrived, and viewed the message payload. Next, you register a client Mule app with Anypoint MQ.



== Register a Client Mule App

After you test the queue, you register a client app in Anypoint MQ. Registering the client app generates the client app ID and client secret that you use to configure Anypoint MQ Connector.

To register a client app: 

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ*.
. Click *Client Apps*:
+
.The screenshot  shows (*1*) the *Client Apps* option and (*2*) blue plus icon (+) icon.
image::mq-tutorial-create-client-apps.png[Client Apps option and blue plus icon]
. Click the blue plus icon (+).
. In the *Create Client App* window, enter `DemoClientApp` and click *Save Changes*.
. Click the client app entry to view the client ID and client secret value in the details pane:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Client App ID* field, and (*2*) the *Show* and (*3*) *Copy* buttons.  
image::mq-tutorial-client-apps-detail.png[Client App ID field, Show and Copy buttons]
+
The client secret value is obfuscated unless you click *Show*.
. Keep the *Client Apps* window open so you can copy the client app ID and client secret in a later step.

You have successfully registered a client Mule app in Anypoint MQ. Next, you create a Mule app in Design Center and connect it to Anypoint MQ.


== Create and Connect a Mule App to Anypoint MQ in Design Center

After you register the client app, you use Design Center to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ, submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API, and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.


=== Prerequisites

* Disable password programs such as LastPass or Okta in your browser before using Design Center.
+
If enabled, the password program inserts passwords in fields in Design Center, which can cause the app to fail. 
* Leave a browser window open to *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* so that you can access the queue and the client app ID and client secret values for the client app you registered previously.

=== Configure an App with Anypoint MQ in Design Center

image::mq-tutorial-dc-publish-select.png[Publish operation]
+
For the other operations:
+
* To construct your Mule app to receive a message sent from a queue, use the *Consume* operation. 
* If your app has tests to determine if message processing succeeded, use the *Ack* operation  
to acknowledge that a message was received and can be deleted.
* If message processing failed, use the *Nack* operation to negatively acknowledge the message and return the message to the queue to be accessed again. 
. In the *Configuration* tab, specify `myDemoQueue` in the *Destination* field.
+
This is the name of the queue you created earlier in this tutorial:
+

image::mq-tutorial-dc-running.png[The mqdemo app running in a temporary environment]

You have successfully used Design Center to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ. Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and using Anypoint MQ to view the results.

=== Test Your Design Center App

After you create your app in Design Center, you test your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.

To test your app:

. In Design Center, click the project type for your app to display the details pane:
+
.The arrow shows the deployment URL in the details pane for your app in Design Center.
image::mq-tutorial-dc-deploy-url.png[Deployment URL in details pane]
. Copy *Deployment url*.
. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt to send the `body` value as an Anypoint MQ message. 
+
Replace _DEPLOYMENT-URL_ with the deployment URL from Design Center. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://DEPLOYMENT-URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Welcome to MuleSoft!"
  }
]'
----
+
The `100` value in the URL is the message ID value as specified by the `/mq{messageId}` value in the HTTP Listener, which is the identifier for your message.
+
Next, you verify that the message arrived in the queue.
. In *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* > *Destinations*, click the name of the `myDemoQueue` queue that you created earlier and specified in the *Destination* setting for your app in Design Center.
. Click *Message Browser* in the left menu:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Message Browser* option and (*2*) the *Get Messages* button for getting messages from the `myDemoQueue` queue.
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png[Message Browser option and Get Messages button]
. Click *Get Messages*.
. Click the message row to view the message payload that you sent in the `curl` command in the details pane:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the message row, (*2*) the message payload, (*3*) the *Return Messages* icon, (*4*) the *Delete* icon, (*5*) the *Full Screen* icon, and (*6*) the close details pane icon (*X*).
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details-curl.png[Selected message row, payload, Return Messages icon, Delete icon, Full Screen icon, and close details pane (X) icons]
+
* Click *Full Screen* to display the message payload in a separate window or *X* to close the details pane.
* Click *Delete* to delete the selected message.
* Click *Return Messages* to return the message to the queue (for example, to enable other applications to read the message). 

. Try changing the body text in the `curl` command and repeat the steps to view the message.

You have successfully tested your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and using Anypoint MQ to view the results. Next, you create a Mule app in Anypoint Studio 7 and connect it to Anypoint MQ.

. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt to send the `body` value as an Anypoint MQ message.
+
Replace _APP-URL_ with the *App url* value that you copied from Runtime Manager. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://APP-URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Message via Runtime Manager"
  }
]'
----
+
The `100` value in the URL is the message ID value as specified by the `/mq{messageId}` value in the HTTP Listener, which is the identifier for your message.
+
If you see a 404 message for `destination not found`, verify that the name of the queue 
in the Studio 7 *MQ Publish* > *Destination* field matches the name of the queue in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*.
+
After making changes, redeploy your Mule app to CloudHub by right-clicking the project in Studio 7 and selecting *Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to CloudHub*. 
. In *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* > *Destinations*, click the name of the `myDemoQueue` queue that you created earlier and specified in the *Destination* setting for your app in Studio 7.
