= Tutorial: Create a Queue and Send Messages to It

Use this tutorial to get started with using Anypoint MQ to send messages to and retrieve messages from a _queue_, which is a temporary storage area for a message. 

In this tutorial, you:

. Create a queue in Anypoint MQ.
. Send messages to the queue, verify that they arrived, and view the message payload.
. Configure a connected app and use the ID and secret to configure Anypoint Connector for MQ (Anypoint MQ Connector) version 4.x.
+
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion]
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion3x]
. Create a Mule 4.x app in Anypoint Studio 7.x, configure Anypoint MQ Connector, and test the connection.
. Optionally, create a Mule 3.9 app in Anypoint Studio 6.x, configure Anypoint MQ Connector for Mule 3, and test the connection.

== Before You Begin

* Familiarity with xref:mq-glossary.adoc[]
* An https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform account^]
* An Enterprise license
+
Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your system
* A https://curl.haxx.se[`curl` command line tool^] for testing 
+
This tutorial uses the HTTP Listener trigger to initiate Anypoint MQ Connector access and a `curl` command to submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API.

== Step 1. Create a Queue

First, you create a queue, send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

To create a queue:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. If you want to test the queue in Anypoint Studio 7.x, switch to any environment except Design. 
+
For example, click the environment button and select *Production*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-switch-env.png["Environment button"]
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-destinations-option.png["Destinations option and the Add icon"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. *Destinations* navigation menu displays available queues.
.. *Add* icon creates a new queue or exchange.
. Click the *Add* icon (image:icon-blue-plus.png["Add icon in Destinations",2.5%,2.5%]) to display the menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-create-choices.png["Add icon menu options"]
. Select *Queue*.
. [[create-demo-queue]] In the *Create Queue* window, enter `myDemoQueue` in the *ID* field:
+
image::mq-create-queues.png["Create Queue window"]
// replace screenshot
+
Queue names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (. -) characters. They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
. If you want, specify any other queue settings. 
+
For information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#create-a-queue[Create a Queue].
. Click *Create Queue*.
+ 
Anypoint MQ creates the queue in the *Destinations* page:
+
image::mq-tutorial-queue-details.png["Destinations page with the new queue"]
// I think this screenshot is OK

You have successfully created a queue. Next, you send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

== Step 2. Send Messages to a Queue and Verify That They Arrived

After you create the queue, you test the queue sending messages to it, validating that the messages arrived in the queue, and retrieving them from the queue.

To send and receive messages from a queue:

. In the *Destinations* page, click `myDemoQueue`.
. Click *Message Sender* in the navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-page.png["Message Sender navigation menu"]
. Leave the *Type* field set to *Text* and enter `Hello Mules!` in the *Payload* field.
. If you want, toggle *Add User Properties*, specify the property name-value pairs to send, and click *Add Property*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-user-props.png["Add User Properties toggle in the Message Sender page"]
+
include::partial$mq-user-props.adoc[tag=mquserpropsTypeColor]
. Click *Send*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*, enter the following in the *Payload* field, and click *Send*:
+
[source,csv,linenums]
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*, enter the following in the *Payload* field, and click *Send*:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
Next, verify that the messages arrived in the queue.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue type for `myDemoQueue` to display its details.
+
The details pane shows the number of messages in the queue:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msgs-in-queue.png["Three messages in the myDemoQueue queue in the details pane"]
. In the details pane, click the queue details label `myDemoQueue`.
. Click *Message Browser* in the navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png["Message Browser in the navigation menu"]
. Enter `5` for the number of messages to retrieve and `10` for the number of seconds to poll.
+
You can retrieve between 1-500 messages and poll for between 1-3600 seconds.
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
Anypoint MQ retrieves the messages from the queue and displays them in the Message Browser.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png["Selected message row and the payload in the details pane"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Selected message.
.. Message payload in the details pane.


You have successfully created a queue in Anypoint MQ, sent messages to the queue, verified that the messages arrived, and viewed the message payload. Next, you create a connected app to connect a Mule app to Anypoint MQ.


[[configure-connected-app]]
== Step 3. Configure a Connected App

After you test the queue, you configure a connected app, which generates the ID and secret you use to configure Anypoint MQ Connector.

[NOTE]
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion]
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion3x]

include::partial$mq-shared-connect-apps.adoc[tags=!ScopesConnApp]

You have successfully configured a connected app. Next, you create a Mule app in Anypoint Studio and connect it to Anypoint MQ.


[[configure-mule-4-studio]]
== Step 4. Create and Connect a Mule 4.x App to Anypoint MQ in Anypoint Studio 7.x

After you configure the connected app, use Anypoint Studio 7.x to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ, deploy the app to CloudHub, submit a `curl` command to test the connection, and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.

=== Before You Begin

* Install Studio 7.x. 
+
See xref:studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[].
* In Anypoint Platform, change to any environment except Design.
+
Ensure that the queue you created in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* is also in this environment.

=== Configure an App with Anypoint MQ in Anypoint Studio 7.x

+
Studio 7.x supports Mule 4.x.
. Click *Add to project*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-exchange-add-to-project.png["Add to project icon in Exchange"]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Proceed* and then click *OK* in Studio.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *HTTP*, and then drag the *Listener* to the Studio canvas:
+
image::mq-tutorial-studio7-palette.png["HTTP Connector and Listener operations in the Mule Palette"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. HTTP Connector displays the Listener operation.
.. Listener operation identifies the operation to drag to the Mule Palette.
. Click *Anypoint MQ* and then drag *Publish* to the *Process* area for the Listener on the canvas:
+
image::mq-tutorial-studio7-flow.png["Publish operation in the Studio 7.x canvas"]
. In the canvas, click *Listener*.
. In the Listener properties window, set *General* > *Path* to `/mq/{messageId}`:
+
image::mq-tutorial-studio7-listener-props.png["Listener properties window"]
. Click the *Add* icon (image:icon-green-plus.png["Add icon in Studio",2.5%,2.5%]) for the *Connector configuration* field.
. In the HTTP Listener *Global Element Properties* window, verify that *Host* is set to `All Interfaces [0.0.0.0]` and *Port* is set to `8081`, and then click *OK*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-studio7-listener-config.png["Host and Port settings in the Global Element Properties for the Listener"]
+
The Listener properties window now indicates that there are no errors.
. In the canvas, click the *Publish* operation.
. In the Publish properties window, set *Destination* to the <<create-demo-queue,`myDemoQueue`>> queue that you created earlier in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-studio7-mq-props.png["Destination property and Add icon for the Publish operation"]
+
The queue must be located in an environment other than Design.
. Click the *Add* icon (image:icon-green-plus.png["Add icon in Studio",2.5%,2.5%]) for the *Connector configuration* field to display the *Global Element Properties* window.
. Return to your *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* browser window to copy the URL, ID, and secret values:
+
.. Click *Destinations*.
.. [[copy-url-studio]] Click *Copy* and select *Connector version 4.x and later* from the menu to copy the URL:
+
image::mq-tutorial-url.png["Copy button in the Destinations page"]
+
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tags=mqConnectorVersion3x]
.. In the *Anypoint MQ Config* window in Studio, paste the URL in the *URL* field.
.. Return to the <<connected-apps-window,Connected Apps>> window and copy the ID and secret for the app.
.. Paste the ID and secret values to the *Anypoint MQ Config* window in Studio:
+
--
image::mq-tutorial-studio7-mq-config.png["URL, Client App ID, and Client Secret fields in the Anypoint MQ Config window"]
--
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure that the values are correct, and then click *OK* twice.
. Save your project. 
. In *Package Explorer* in Studio, right-click `mq-demo` and select *Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to CloudHub*.
. At the prompt, select the environment to which to deploy the app.
. In the Anypoint Platform *Deploying Application* window, click *Deploy Application*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-deploy-app.png["Deploy Application button in the Deploying Applications page"]

You have successfully used Studio 7.x to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ. Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and using Anypoint MQ to view the results.

=== Test Your Mule 4.x App in Studio 7.x

After you create the app in Studio 7.x, you test your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.

To test your app:

. In Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager* > *Applications* and ensure that the `mq-demo` app is running.
. Click the status for the `mq-demo` app to display the details pane.
. Copy the *App url* value:
+
image::mq-tutorial-rtm-deploy-url.png["App url value in Runtime Manager"]
. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt to send the `body` value as an Anypoint MQ message.
+
Replace _APP-URL_ with the *App url* value that you copied from Runtime Manager. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://APP-URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Welcome to MuleSoft!"
  }
]'
----
+
The `100` value in the URL is the message ID value as specified by the `/mq/{messageId}` value in the HTTP Listener, which is the identifier for your message.
+
If you see a 404 message for `destination not found`, verify that the name of the queue 
in the Studio 7.x *MQ Publish* > *Destination* field matches the name of the queue in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*.
+
After making changes, redeploy your Mule app to CloudHub by right-clicking the project in Studio 7.x and selecting *Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to CloudHub*. 
. In *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* > *Destinations*, click the name of the <<create-demo-queue,`myDemoQueue`>> queue that you created earlier and specified in the *Destination* setting for your app in Studio 7.x.
. Click *Message Browser* in the navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png["Message Browser in the navigation menu"]
. Enter `5` for the number of messages to retrieve and `10` for the number of seconds to poll.
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
Anypoint MQ retrieves the messages from the queue and displays them in the Message Browser.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png["Selected message row and the payload in the details pane"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Selected message.
.. Message payload in the details pane.
. Try changing the body text in the `curl` command and repeat the steps to view the message.

[[configure-mule-3-studio]]
== Step 5. Create and Connect a Mule 3.9 App to Anypoint MQ in Anypoint Studio 6.x

If you use Mule 3.9, you can use Anypoint Studio 6.x to create a Mule 3.9 app similar to the app you created in Studio 7.x.
In Studio 6.x, you can deploy the app to CloudHub and submit a `curl` command to test the connection. 

This section applies only to Anypoint Studio 6.x and Mule 3.9. For Studio 7.x, see <<configure-mule-4-studio, Create and Connect a Mule 4.x App to Anypoint MQ in Anypoint Studio 7.x>>.

[NOTE]
include::partial$mq-versions.adoc[tag=mqMuleVersion]

=== Before You Begin

* Install Studio 6.x.
