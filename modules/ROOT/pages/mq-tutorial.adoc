:imagesdir: ../assets/images/

Use this tutorial to get started with using Anypoint MQ to send messages to and retrieve messages from a _queue_, which is a temporary storage area for a message. 

In this tutorial, you:

. Create a queue in Anypoint MQ.
. Send messages to the queue, verify that they arrived, and view the message payload.
. In Anypoint MQ, register a client app that you then use to configure Anypoint MQ Connector. 
. Create an app in Design Center, configure Anypoint MQ Connector, and test the connection.
. Create an app in Anypoint Studio, configure Anypoint MQ Connector, and test the connection.
+
Depending on your Mule version, you create your app in Studio 7 (Mule 4) or Studio 6 (Mule 3).

== Prerequisites

* Familiarity with xref:mq-understanding.adoc[Anypoint MQ terminology]
* An xref::anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform account]
* An Enterprise license
+
Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your system
* A https://curl.haxx.se[`curl` command] for testing 
+
This tutorial uses the HTTP Listener trigger to initiate Anypoint MQ Connector access and a `curl` command to submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API.

== Create a Queue

First, you create a queue, send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

To create a queue:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. If you want to test the queue in Anypoint Studio 7, switch to any environment except Design. 
+
For example, click the environment button and select *Production*:
+

+
[cols="5a,15a,50a"]
|===
| (*1*) | *Destinations* navigation menu | Display available queues.
| (*2*) | Blue plus (*+*) icon | Create a new queue or exchange.
|===
. Click the blue plus icon (+) to display the menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-create-choices.png[Blue plus icon menu options]
. Select *Queue*.
. In the *Create Queue* window, enter `myDemoQueue` in the *ID* field:
+
image::mq-create-queues.png[Create Queue window]
+
Queue names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), periods (.), and hyphens (-). They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
. If you want, specify any other queue settings. 
+
For information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#create-a-queue[Create a Queue].
. Click *Create Queue*.
+ 
The queue is created and appears in the *Destinations* page:
+
image::mq-queue-details.png[Destinations page with the type, ID, and details label for the new queue]
+
[cols="5a,15a,50a"]
|===
| (*1*) | Queue type| Click to display the queue details pane.
| (*2*) | Queue ID| Click to display the *Queue Settings* page.
| (*3*) | Queue details label| Click to display the *Queue Settings* page.
|===

You have successfully created a queue. Next, you send messages to the queue, verify that the messages arrived, and view the message payload.

== Send Messages to a Queue and Verify That They Arrived

After you create the queue, you test the queue you created by sending messages to it, validating that the messages arrived in the queue, and retrieving them from the queue.

To send and receive messages from a queue:

. In the *Destinations* page, click `myDemoQueue`.
. Click *Message Sender* in the left pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-page.png[Message Sender option]
. Enter `Hello Mules!` in the *Payload* field.
+
Leave the *Type* field set to *Text*.
. If you want, toggle *Add User Properties* and specify the property name-value pairs to send:
+
image::mq-tutorial-message-sender-user-props.png[Add User Properties toggle in the Message Sender page]
+
include::partial$mq-user-props.adoc[tag=mquserprops]
. Click *Send*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
. Click *Send*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
. Click *Send*.
+
Next, verify that the messages arrived in the queue.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue type for `myDemoQueue` to display its details in the right pane.
+
The details pane shows the number of messages in the queue:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msgs-in-queue.png[Three messages in the myDemoQueue queue in the details pane]
. In the details pane, click the queue label, `myDemoQueue`.
. Click the *Message Browser* navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png[Message Browser navigation menu]
. Specify the number of messages (1-500) and the time to poll (1-3600 seconds).
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
Anypoint MQ retrieves the messages from the queue and displays them in the Message Browser.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png[Selected message row, payload in the details pane, and Return Messages, Delete, Full Screen, and close details pane icons]
+
include::partial$mq-msg-browser-details.adoc[tag=mqMsgBrowserDetails]
+
//Shared Delete Message
include::partial$mq-delete-msg.adoc[tag=deleteMsg]
+
[NOTE]
//Shared Big Payload
include::partial$mq-big-payload.adoc[tag=mqBigPayload]


You have successfully created a queue in Anypoint MQ, sent messages to the queue, verified that the messages arrived, and viewed the message payload. Next, you register a client Mule app with Anypoint MQ.



== Register a Client Mule App

After you test the queue, you register a client app in Anypoint MQ. Registering the client app generates the client app ID and client secret that you use to configure Anypoint MQ Connector.

To register a client app: 

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ*.
. Click *Client Apps*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-create-client-apps.png[Client Apps option and blue plus icon]
+
[cols="5a,15a,50a"]
|===
| (*1*) | *Client Apps* navigation menu | Display and create client apps.
| (*2*) | Blue plus (+) icon| Click to add a client app.
|===
. Click the blue plus (+) icon.
. In the *Create Client App* window, enter `DemoClientApp` and click *Save Changes*.
. Click the client app name to view the client app ID and client secret value in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-client-apps-detail.png[Client app name, Copy, and Show buttons]
+
include::partial$mq-msg-browser-details.adoc[tag=mqClientAppsDetail]
. Keep the *Client Apps* window open so you can copy the client app ID and client secret in a later step.

You have successfully registered a client Mule app in Anypoint MQ. Next, you create a Mule app in Design Center and connect it to Anypoint MQ.


== Create and Connect a Mule App to Anypoint MQ in Design Center

After you register the client app, you use Design Center to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ, submit REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API, and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.


=== Prerequisites

* Disable password programs such as LastPass or Okta in your browser before using Design Center.
+
If enabled, the password program inserts passwords in fields in Design Center, which can cause the app to fail. 
* Leave a browser window open to *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* so that you can access the queue and the client app ID and client secret values for the client app you registered previously.

=== Configure an App with Anypoint MQ in Design Center

To configure an app in Design Center:

. In *Anypoint Platform*, click *Design Center* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Create new* > *New Mule App* to create a new integration flow.
. In the *New Mule App* window, enter `mqdemo` for the project name and click *Create App*.
. In the help wizard, click *Go straight to canvas*:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-goto-canvas.png[Go straight to canvas link]
. Click the *Trigger* box and enter `H` to search for the HTTP Listener:
+

. Click the connector name, and then click the *Publish* operation:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-publish-select.png[Publish operation]
+
For the other operations:
+
* To construct your Mule app to receive a message sent from a queue, use the *Consume* operation. 
* If your app has tests to determine if message processing succeeded, use the *Ack* operation  
to acknowledge that a message was received and can be deleted.
* If message processing failed, use the *Nack* operation to negatively acknowledge the message and return the message to the queue to be accessed again. 
. In the *Configuration* window, click *Add Connection*.
. In the *Configure Connection* window, specify `myDemoQueue` in the *Connection Name* field and select *Connection* as the connection type.

. Return to your *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* browser window to copy the URL, client app ID, and client secret values:
+
.. Click *Destinations* and copy the URL to the *Configure Connection* page in Design Center:
+
image::mq-tutorial-url.png[Copy button in the Destinations page]
.. Click *Client Apps* and click `DemoClientApp` to display the details pane.
+

.. Copy the client app ID and client secret values from the details pane to the *Configure Connection* page in Design Center:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-client-id-secret.png[Client App ID field and Client Secret field in the Configure Connection page]
. Click *Test* to ensure that you have access to your client app:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-test-connection.png[Success box]
+
* If successful, the green *Success* box appears.
* If unsuccessful, ensure that the client app ID, client secret, and URL values are correct.
+
If the URL does not match the URL in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*, copy the URL from Anypoint MQ to the Design Center window and click *Test* again.

. Click *Save* twice.
. In the *Publish Configuration* window, enter `myDemoQueue`.
+
This is the name of the queue you created earlier in this tutorial.
. Click the *Close* (*X*) icon to close the Publish Configuration window:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-mq-close.png[Close icon]
. Select *Deploy Application* from the menu to the right of the *Test* button: 
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-deploy-option.png[Deploy Application menu option in Design Center]
. In the *Deploy Mule application* window, select the target environment and application name, and then click *Deploy*.
+
After the app deploys successfully, you can click in the *Deployment success* popup to view the app in Runtime Manager.

You have successfully used Design Center to configure an app that connects to Anypoint MQ. Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and using Anypoint MQ to view the results.

=== Test Your Design Center App

After you create your app in Design Center, you test your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.

To test your app:

. In Design Center, click the project type for your app to display the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-dc-deploy-url.png[Deployment URL in details pane]
. Copy the value of *Deployment url*.
. Run the following `curl` command from a command prompt to send the `body` value as an Anypoint MQ message. 
+
Replace _DEPLOYMENT-URL_ with the deployment URL from Design Center. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://DEPLOYMENT-URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Welcome to MuleSoft!"
  }
]'
----
+
The `100` value in the URL is the message ID value as specified by the `/mq{messageId}` value in the HTTP Listener, which is the identifier for your message.
+
Next, you verify that the message arrived in the queue.
. In *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* > *Destinations*, click the name of the `myDemoQueue` queue that you created earlier and specified in the *Destination* setting for your app in Design Center.
. Click the *Message Browser* navigation menu:
+
image::mq-tutorial-get-messages.png[Message Browser navigation menu]
. Specify the number of messages (1-500) and the time to poll (1-3600 seconds).
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
Anypoint MQ retrieves the messages from the queue and displays them in the Message Browser.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-msg-browser-payload-details.png[Selected message row, payload in the details pane, and Return Messages, Delete, Full Screen, and close details pane icons]
+
include::partial$mq-msg-browser-details.adoc[tag=mqMsgBrowserDetails]
+
//Shared Delete Message
include::partial$mq-delete-msg.adoc[tag=deleteMsg]
+
[NOTE]
//Shared Big Payload
include::partial$mq-big-payload.adoc[tag=mqBigPayload]
. Try changing the body text in the `curl` command and repeat the steps to view the message.

You have successfully tested your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Anypoint MQ Broker API and using Anypoint MQ to view the results. Next, you create a Mule app in Anypoint Studio 7 and connect it to Anypoint MQ.


== Create and Connect a Mule 4 App to Anypoint MQ in Anypoint Studio 7
