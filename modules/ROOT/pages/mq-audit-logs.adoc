The Anypoint Platform audit logging service logs Anypoint MQ actions on queues,
exchanges, and client applications.

With the *Organization Administrator* or *Audit Log Viewer* role, you can access the audit logs relevant to your business group from the *Audit Log* page in Access Management or using the Audit Log REST API.

For example, you might use the audit logs to determine:

* All Anypoint MQ actions of a user
* All Anypoint MQ actions on an object, such as a queue or exchange

[NOTE]
--
The audit logging service doesn't record the following as auditable actions:

* Sending, receiving, or browsing messages
* Failed Anypoint MQ operations

=== Payloads

A _payload_ is a JSON-formatted text file that lists the Anypoint MQ settings in place
when the action occurs. 

For each action on the *Audit Log* page, click the blue *Download payload* button
to download a payload file (`payload.txt`).

The following example shows a formatted version of the
contents of `payload.txt` after creating a queue:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "organizationId":"<organizationID>",
    "environmentId":"<enviromentID",
    "objectName":"testQ",
    "userName":"myUserName",
    "objectId":"testQ",
    "regionId":"us-east-1",
    "defaultTtlMillis":604800000,
    "defaultLockTtlMillis":180000,
    "encrypted":true,
    "deadLetterQueueId":"myDLQ",
    "maxDeliveries":10,
    "fifo":false
}
----

The possible fields in `payload.txt` are:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|`organizationId` |Organization ID for the current Anypoint Platform account

You can use the organization ID to access Anypoint MQ REST APIs.
|`environmentId` |Environment ID for the current Anypoint Platform account

You can use the environment ID to access Anypoint MQ REST APIs.
|`objectName` |Name of the queue, exchange, or client application
|`userName` |Username for the Anypoint Platform account
|`objectId` |Name of the queue, exchange, or client application

The `objectID` is the same value as `objectName`.
|`regionId` |Region location where you process your Anypoint MQ connections
|`defaultTtlMillis` |Default time to live (in milliseconds)

This value specifies how long unprocessed messages persist before being deleted.
|`defaultLockTtlMillis` |Default lock time to live (in milliseconds) for the queue or exchange you create

This value specifies the duration that a message is unavailable to other applications before being put back into the queue.
|`encrypted` |Whether the queue or message exchange is encrypted

//Shared Encryption
include::partial$mq-faq.adoc[tag=faqEncryption]
|`deadLetterQueueId` |Name of the dead letter queue to which the current object is associated
|`maxDeliveries` |How many times Anypoint MQ tries to deliver messages in the queue before rerouting the message to the dead letter queue
|`fifo` |Whether the queue is a FIFO queue (`true`) or not (`false`)

[NOTE]
This field is set to `true` at the time you create the FIFO queue.
Subsequent changes to a FIFO queue set the `fifo` field to `null`.
