= Configure Rules on Message Exchanges to Route Messages

Anypoint MQ includes the ability to create _intelligent message routing rules_ to route a subset of the messages published to an exchange to a specific queue.

You configure the message routing rule on the binding on an exchange.
When you publish a message to the exchange, the message routing rule
routes the message to a queue only if the message includes
a property or header that matches the rule.

[NOTE]

For example, you might want to designate a queue to handle all orders for size medium items and another queue for premium items.


To route messages published to an exchange to specific queues:

. Define message routing rules on the binding between the exchange and the queue.
+
You configure one message routing rule per binding on the exchange.
include::partial$mq-msg-exchange.adoc[tag=msgRulesEval]
. Specify filtering criteria by defining `properties` and `headers` in the message.
+
If you publish the following message to the `purchases` exchange,
the exchange forwards it only to `premiumPurchases` queue and 
not to the `sizeMedium` queue based on the routing rule configuration.
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "headers" : {
        "itemSize" : "large"
    },
    "body" : "User added an item to the cart"
}

. Complete the fields on the *Create Routing Rule* page.
+
image::mq-exchange-create-routing-rule.png["Create Routing Rule page"]
+
* Specify the property name and value to match.
* For each property type, specify a <<matcher-type,matcher type>>.
. Click *Add Rule*.

== Change a Message Routing Rule 

To change a message routing rule:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in navigation area or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations* and then click the name of the exchange to configure rules.
. On the *Exchange Settings* page, click *Edit Rule* to change a rule on a bound queue.
+
image::mq-exchange-edit-rule-bound-queues.png["Edit Rule button on the Exchange Settings page"]
. On the *Edit Routing Rule* page, change the rule settings.
+
For information about property types and matcher types, see <<matcher-type>>.
. Click *Save Rule*.

== Delete a Message Routing Rule 

To delete a message routing rule:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in navigation area or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations* and then click the name of the exchange to configure rules.
. On the *Exchange Settings* page, click *Delete Rule* .

. In the *Delete Routing Rule* confirmation box, select the checkbox and click *Delete Routing Rule* to verify that you want to delete the rule.

== Create or Change a Message Routing Rule with Anypoint Admin API

For information on using the Anypoint MQ Admin API to manage message routing rules, see
xref:mq-apis.adoc#routing-rules-api[Create or Change Message Routing Rules].


[[matcher-type]]
=== Matcher Type

[%header,cols="10a,20a,60a"]
|===
|Property Type | Matcher Type |Description
.5+|String | Equals | Message property value is an exact match for the value in this rule.
| Prefix | Message property value starts with the value in this rule.
| Any of | Message property value matches any of the values in this rule.
| None of | Message property value does not match any of the values in this rule.
| Exists | Message includes a property with a name that matches the property name in this rule.
.8+|Number | Equals | Message property value is equal to the value in this rule.
| Less than | Message property value is less than the value in this rule.
| Less than or equal | Message property value is less than or equal to the value in this rule.
| Greater than | Message property value is greater than the value in this rule.
| Greater than or equal | Message property value is greater than or equal to the value in this rule.
| Range | Message property value is within the inclusive range of values specified in this rule.
| None of | Message property value does not match any of the values in this rule.
| Exists | Message includes a property with a name that matches the property name in this rule.

--
Property values support the period (.) character (not the comma (,) character) for decimal notation in numeric property values.

[[send-message-with-routing-props]]
== Send a Message with Routing Properties

To send messages to an exchange and route them to specific queues, 
use either:

* Anypoint MQ *Message Sender* page:
+
When sending the message:
+
--
.. Toggle *Add User Properties*.
.. Specify the filter criteria as property name-value pairs to send.
--
+
For information, see 
xref:mq-exchanges.adoc#send-a-message-to-a-message-exchange[Send a Message to a Message Exchange].
* Anypoint MQ Broker API:
+
For information, see 
xref:mq-apis.adoc#send-message-routing[Send a Message with Routing Properties].

To view the routing properties on a published message:

. In the *Message Sender* page for the exchange, click *View Messages* for a queue that is bound to the exchange.
+
Anypoint MQ displays the *Message Browser* page for the selected queue.
. Click *Get Messages*.
. Click the message row to view the message payload, including the user properties, in the details pane:
+

+
See 
xref:mq-queues.adoc#get-a-message-from-a-queue[Get a Message from a Queue].


[[intelligent-routing-restrictions]]
== Requirements and Restrictions

[IMPORTANT]
include::partial$mq-user-props.adoc[tag=mqNumberPropsConnector]

Anypoint MQ supports message routing rules with the following restrictions:

* Exchanges must have 10 or fewer queue bindings.
+
include::partial$mq-user-props.adoc[tag=msgExchangeMaxRouting]
* You can configure a message routing rule on only one property with the following restrictions:
+
** Maximum size of the property name is 180 bytes.
** Maximum size of the property value is 45 KB.
* Property values for routing rules can contain whitespace, alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), and punctuation (@ ! & | # $ % - _ : ; , . ') characters.


Anypoint MQ evaluates messages against the routing rule only if they meet the following criteria:

* Total number of headers and properties is fewer than 500.
+
This total includes operational headers, such as `messageId` and `createdTimestamp`, that Anypoint MQ creates.
* Maximum total size of headers and properties is 215 KB.


If a message doesn't meet these criteria, Anypoint MQ ignores the headers and properties
when evaluating the message against the message routing rules.

Anypoint MQ retains the headers and properties in the payload and, when it publishes the message to the exchange, the headers and properties are available for consumption.
