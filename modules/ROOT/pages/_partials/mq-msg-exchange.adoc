// tag::msgExchangeMax[]
You can bind a maximum of 450 queues to a message exchange.
// end::msgExchangeMax[]

// tag::msgExchangeMaxRouting[]
You can bind a maximum of 10 queues to an exchange with message routing rules defined.
If an exchange has more than 10 queue bindings, you cannot use intelligent message routing.
// end::msgExchangeMaxRouting[]

// tag::exchBindingNoRules[]
Any bindings without configured message routing rules continue to receive all messages from the exchange.
// end::exchBindingNoRules[]

// tag::msgRulesEval[]
Anypoint MQ evaluates the configured message routing rules against all `headers` and `properties` attributes in the published messages.
// end::msgRulesEval[]


// tag::msgExchangePublishOnly[]
Message exchanges support only the Publish operation; they don't support the Consume operation.
Anypoint MQ forwards messages published to a message exchange to the bound queues and the app consumes from the queue.
If an app attempts to consume from a message exchange,
the Anypoint MQ REST API throws the following error:
`The destination should be a queue.`
