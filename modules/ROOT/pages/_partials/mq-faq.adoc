// MQ FAQ SHARED
// tag::faqUsageOverage[]
If your usage exceeds your license limit, Anypoint MQ continues to work.
MuleSoft notifies your account administrator and team with any billing-related information.
// end::faqUsageOverage[]


// tag::faqEncryption[]
If you configure Anypoint MQ queues for encryption at rest, the payloads are encrypted with the AES-256 GCM algorithm on the server side.
// end::faqEncryption[]

// tag::messageGroupLimit[]
Anypoint MQ doesn't limit the number of message groups in a FIFO queue.
// end::messageGroupLimit[]

// tag::failedTPS[]
Failed requests count against TPS.
// end::failedTPS[]

// tag::apiRequests[]
All requests to the broker API count against your monthly quota.
Requests include sending, receiving, and acknowledging messages
and operations on queues and exchanges.
// end::apiRequests[]

// tag::returnVals[]
Anypoint MQ doesn't use `messageReceiptCount` and `billableUnitCount` for billing, and you can safely ignore them.
Anypoint MQ uses `messageReceiptCount` to determine the message units displayed on the *MQ Usage* page; `billableUnitCount` is an internally used value set to the same value as `messageReceiptCount`.
