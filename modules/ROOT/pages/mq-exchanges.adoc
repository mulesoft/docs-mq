= Configure Message Exchanges


Using a _message exchange_, you can send a message to one or more standard xref:mq-queues.adoc[queues] that are bound to the message exchange.
You can also create _intelligent message routing rules_ to route messages to specific queues that are bound to the message exchange.
For information, see
xref:mq-routing-rules.adoc[].

[NOTE]
To maintain message order, FIFO queues don't support message routing rules.

The maximum size of a message sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.

Before creating a message exchange, create one or more queues.
For information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#create-a-queue[Create a Queue].

== Create a Message Exchange

To create a message exchange:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* from the navigation menu or the main Anypoint Platform screen.

+
. Select *Exchange*.
+
For *Queue* or *FIFO Queue*, see xref:mq-queues.adoc[].
. In the *Create Exchange* page, name the message exchange. 
+
Message exchange names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), periods (.), and hyphens (-). They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
. Click the checkboxes to bind queues to this message exchange:
+

To bind a queue to a message exchange:

. Click the message exchange ID to display the *Exchange Settings* page:
+
image::mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2.png["(1) Checkboxes for multiple select, and (2) Unbind and (3) Bind buttons"]
+
. In the settings page, click *Bind* or *Unbind* for each single queue you want to bind to or unbind from the message exchange.

== Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is similar to sending a message to a queue. The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange. The maximum size for a message sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.

// MQ Payload Conversion
include::partial$mq-big-payload.adoc[tag=mqPayloadConvert]

To send a message to a message exchange:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the navigation menu.
. Click the message exchange ID to display the *Exchange Settings* page.
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender* in the navigation menu:
+
image::mq-exchange-payload.png["Message Sender option for the exchange"]
+
. Leave the *Type* field set to *Text*.
. Enter text in the *Payload* field, such as `Hello Queues from myMessageExchange`.
. If you want, toggle *Add User Properties* and specify the property name-value pairs to send:
+

+
//Shared User Property names
include::partial$mq-user-props.adoc[tag=mquserprops]
+
[NOTE]
If the message exchange has routing rules defined, additional restrictions apply.
See 
xref:mq-exchanges.adoc#intelligent-routing-restrictions[Requirements and Restrictions].
. Click *Send*.
. Click *View Messages* for a queue that is bound to the exchange to view the queue with the Message Browser.
+
See xref:mq-queues.adoc#get-a-message-from-a-queue[Get a Message from a Queue].

You also send JSON content or comma-separated values (CSV) in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. See 
xref:mq-queues.adoc#send-a-json-message-to-a-queue[Send a JSON Message to a Queue] and 
xref:mq-queues.adoc#send-a-csv-message-to-a-queue[Send a CSV Message to a Queue].

== Delete a Message Exchange

If a message exchange is no longer needed, you can delete it. All queue bindings for the deleted exchange queue are lost. Clients can't publish or subscribe to the exchange.

To delete a message exchange:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the navigation menu.
. In the *Destinations* page, click the message exchange type for the exchange to display the details pane.
. Click the *Delete* icon:
+
image::mq-exchange-delete.png["Delete icon in the details pane for deleting an exchange"]
. In the *Delete Exchange* window, select the checkbox to confirm and click *Delete Exchange*.
