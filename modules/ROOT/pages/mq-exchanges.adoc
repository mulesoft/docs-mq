Using a _message exchange_, you can send a message to one or more standard xref:mq-queues.adoc[queues] that are bound to the message exchange. The maximum size of a message sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.

FIFO does not support the use of a message exchange. Similarly, FIFO queues cannot be bound to a message exchange.

Before creating a message exchange, create one or more queues. For information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#create-a-queue[Create Queues].

To create a message exchange:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* from the left navigation area or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations*.

+
For *Queue* or *FIFO Queue*, see xref:mq-queues.adoc[Configure Queues].
. In the *Create Exchange* page, name the message exchange. 
+
Message exchange names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), periods (.), and hyphens (-). They cannot contain spaces or other characters.
