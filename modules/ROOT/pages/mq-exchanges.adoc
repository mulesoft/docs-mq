= Sending Messages to Multiple Queues Using Message Exchanges

You can send messages to multiple standard
xref:mq-queues.adoc[queues] simultaneously by binding those queues to
a _message exchange_. 

You can also route messages to specific queues that are bound to the message exchange
by creating _intelligent message-routing rules_ on the bindings.
For information, see xref:mq-routing-rules.adoc[].

The maximum size of a message sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.
// Max Msg Exchange

Before creating a message exchange, create one or more queues.
For information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#create-a-queue[Create a Queue].

[NOTE]
====
Message exchanges support only the Publish operation; they don't support the Consume operation.
Anypoint MQ forwards messages published to a message exchange to the bound queues and the app consumes from the queue.

If an app attempts to consume from a message exchange,
the Anypoint MQ REST API throws the following error:
`The destination should be a queue.`

== Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is similar to sending a message to a queue. The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange. The maximum size for a message sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the navigation menu.
. Click the message exchange ID to display the *Exchange Settings* page.
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender* in the navigation menu:

You also send JSON content or comma-separated values (CSV) in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. See 
xref:mq-queues.adoc#send-a-json-message-to-a-queue[Send a JSON Message to a Queue] and
