= Anypoint MQ REST APIs

The Anypoint MQ APIs enable you to use REST to send and receive messages, administer queues and message exchanges, and analyze results.

Anypoint MQ provides these APIs:

* <<mqadminapi,Anypoint MQ Admin API>>
* <<mqbrokerapi,Anypoint MQ Broker API>>
* <<mqstatapi,Anypoint MQ Stats API>>

Anypoint MQ portals are available in the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/[Developer portal^].

== Workflow for an API

The following example with the Broker API illustrates the workflow for accessing an API:

image::mq-api-workflow.png[]

Steps:

. An app sends a request to Anypoint MQ and sets how long to hold the lock on the message.
. Anypoint MQ sends the message and the lock ID.
. The app acknowledges the message and requests Anypoint MQ to delete the message, or the app negatively acknowledges the message and requests Anypoint MQ to make the message available to other apps. The app sends the message ID and lock ID to Anypoint MQ. 
// For additional information on setting automatic ACK or NACK, see xref:mq-ack-mode.adoc[Acknowledge a Message].
. If no action is taken and the duration of a lock's time to live expires, the message is negatively acknowledged and returns to the queue to be available for other apps.

[[authorize-api]]
== Authorize API Access

Before accessing an API, you need to acquire an access token:

* <<mqadminapi,Anypoint MQ Admin API>>
+
Get an access token for an Anypoint Platform user.
* <<mqbrokerapi,Anypoint MQ Broker API>>
+
Get a token from Anypoint MQ by supplying the client ID and client secret for an MQ app.
* <<mqstatapi,Anypoint MQ Stats API>>
+
Get an access token for an Anypoint Platform user.

To use a Connected App with the Anypoint MQ REST APIs, see <<authorize-api-connected-apps>>.

The `curl` command for each is explained in the API sections.

[[authorize-api-connected-apps]]
=== Authorize API Access for Connected Apps

To use a Connected App with the Anypoint MQ REST APIs, see:

** xref:mq-connected-apps.adoc[] to create the Connected App.
** xref:access-management::connected-apps-developers.adoc#oidc-endpoints-and-tokens[OIDC Endpoints and Tokens] to get the access token.

[NOTE]
include::partial$mq-connect-apps.adoc[tag=mqConnAppEndpointSupport]


[[mqadminapi]]
== Anypoint MQ Admin API

The Anypoint MQ Admin API provides access to Anypoint MQ administrative functionality.

You can use the 
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-mq-admin/[Admin API^] to create and manage apps, queues, and message exchanges.

If you call the Anypoint MQ Admin API for distinct environments within one minute,
the API throttles your requests to 50 transactions per minute (TPM).

These examples use the Anypoint MQ Admin API to create queues and message routing rules from the command line using `curl`:

* <<get-access-token>>
* <<fifo-queue-api>>
* <<routing-rules-api>>


[[get-access-token]]
=== Get the Access Token 

To access the Anypoint MQ Admin API, you must first authenticate using the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/access-management-api/[Anypoint Access Management API^].

To use the Admin API, you can get the access token from the Anypoint Platform user.
The access token is also known as the Bearer.
The default time to live (TTL) for the access token is 60 minutes.

You can get the organization ID and environment ID in the `payload.txt` file that Anypoint Platform creates for any auditable action in MQ.
See xref:access-management::audit-logging.adoc#to-query-audit-logging-for-anypoint-mq[MQ Audit Logging].

Use a `curl` command like the following to get the access token:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}' 
----

This command returns output similar to:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "access_token": "42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "redirectUrl": "/home/"
}
----


[[fifo-queue-api]]
=== Create a FIFO Queue

You can create a FIFO queue using the Anypoint MQ Admin API by including the `"fifo": true` field.

[NOTE]
The organization from which you use the Administration portal must have an Anypoint MQ FIFO entitlement.
See xref:mq-faq.adoc[Anypoint MQ FAQ] for the regions where Anypoint MQ is available.

Use a `curl` command like the following to create a FIFO queue:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/mq/admin/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/ENVIRONMENT_ID/regions/REGION_ID/destinations/queues/QUEUE_ID" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN' \
--data-raw '{
  "defaultTtl" : 120000,
  "defaultLockTtl" : 10000,
  "encrypted" : false,
  "fifo" : true
}'
----

[[routing-rules-api]]
=== Create or Change Message Routing Rules

To route a subset of the messages that are published to an exchange to a specific queue,
use the Admin API to create message routing rules on the binding between the exchange and the queue.

[NOTE]
The new message routing rule can take up to 15 minutes to take effect.

include::partial$mq-msg-exchange.adoc[tag=exchBindingNoRules]

To create a message routing rule, use a `curl` command like the following:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/mq/admin/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/ENVIRONMENT_ID/regions/REGION_ID/bindings/exchanges/purchases/queues/premiumPurchases/rules/routing" \
--header 'Authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "routingRules" : [{
        "propertyName" : "itemCategory",
        "propertyType" : "STRING",
        "matcherType" : "EQ",
        "value" : "premium"
    }]
}'
----

This message routing rule routes any message published to the `purchases` exchange that includes a property or header with
the name `itemCategory` and the value `premium` to the `premiumPurchases` queue.

To change an existing routing rule, submit another `PUT` request with the new message routing rule configuration.
A `PUT` request replaces the existing message routing rule on the binding with the new rule.
Any changes or additions to a message routing rule can take up to 15 minutes to take effect.

For information about:

* Supported payload for `/rules/routing`,
see this endpoint in the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-mq-admin/minor/1.0/console/method/%23741/[Anypoint MQ Admin API^].
* Publishing a message with routing properties, see <<send-message-routing>>.
* Message routing rule requirements, see
xref:mq-routing-rules.adoc#intelligent-routing-restrictions[Requirements and Restrictions].

[[mqbrokerapi]]
== Anypoint MQ Broker API

The  
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-mq-broker/[Anypoint MQ Broker API^] enables clients to publish, retrieve, route, and acknowledge messages from queues and message exchanges.

You can get the organization ID and environment ID in the `payload.txt` file that Anypoint Platform creates for any auditable action in MQ. See xref:access-management::audit-logging.adoc#to-query-audit-logging-for-anypoint-mq[MQ Audit Logging].

These examples use the Anypoint MQ Broker API to publish and consume messages and to test Anypoint MQ from the command line using `curl`.

* <<get-broker-access-token>>
* <<send-messages-api>>
* <<send-message-routing>>
* <<retrieve-message-api>>

You must substitute the placeholder string, `ORGANIZATION_ID` with the proper values for authorization and token strings. These examples use Postman to access the queue.

See the xref:mq-faq.adoc#regions[Anypoint MQ FAQ] for the regions where Anypoint MQ and FIFO are available.

[[get-broker-access-token]]
=== Get the Broker API Access Token

Getting the access (bearer) token requires using either a command like curl or an app like Postman. The example that follows uses curl.
If you are a Windows user, you need to https://curl.haxx.se/download.html[download a curl command^] before accessing the information.

The access token in this section can only be used with the Broker API. Do not use this access token 
with the Stats and Admin APIs. 

All calls to get a token for a particular `CLIENT_ID` return the same token.
Multiple apps using the same `CLIENT_ID` use the same token.
The token is valid for 60 minutes.
Accessing the token before its expiry extends the token validity by another 60 minutes.

To get the Broker API access token:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* > *Client Apps*, and then click the blue plus-circle icon to create an app.
. Get the client ID and client secret and use these values in the curl command below replacing `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/oauth2/token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials"
}'
----
. Submit the `curl` command.
+
The command returns output similar to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{"access_token":"<token>","simple_client":{"envId":"ENVIRONMENT_ID","orgId":"ORGANIZATION_ID"},"token_type":"bearer"}
----

[[send-messages-api]]
=== Send a Message

The following `curl` command publishes a message:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT "https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/ENVIRONMENT_ID/destinations/postmanExchange/messages/552" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache" \
-d '{ 
  "properties": {
    "userDefinedHeader": "User defined stuff",
    "anotherUserDefinedHeader": "Random stuff"
  },

  "body": "This is a message payload"
}' 
----

[[send-message-routing]]
=== Send a Message with Routing Properties

include::partial$mq-msg-exchange.adoc[tag=msgRulesEval]

The following `curl` command publishes a message with the value of the `itemCategory`
property as `premium`.
The message routing rule on the `purchases` exchange binding 
(set up in <<routing-rules-api>>) routes the message to the `premiumPurchases` queue.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT "https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/ENVIRONMENT_ID/destinations/postmanExchange/messages/552" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache" \
-d '{ \
  "properties": {
    "itemCategory": "premium",
  },
  "headers": {
    "itemSize": "large"
  },
  "body": "This is a message payload"
}' 
----

For information about the message routing rule requirements, see
xref:mq-routing-rules.adoc#intelligent-routing-restrictions[Requirements and Restrictions].

[[retrieve-message-api]]
=== Retrieve a Message

The following `curl` command gets a message:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET "https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/ENVIRONMENT_ID/destinations/postmanQueue/messages?pollingTime=10000&batchSize=1&lockTtl=10000" \
-H "Authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache"
----


You can control whether to show the message payload in the response using the `payloadVisibility` query parameter.
This parameter is useful when retrieving large payloads.

The `payloadVisibility` parameter takes the following options: 

* `full`: Shows the message payload in the response. +
This option is the default.
* `none`: Hides the message payload in the response.
* `conditional`: Hides the message payload if the payload size is larger than 1 MB. 

If the payload is hidden because `payloadVisibility` is set to `none` or `conditional`, the response includes `payloadHidden=true` in the message header.

The following `curl` command gets a message and payload, displaying the payload only if the payload size is smaller than 1 MB:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/ENVIRONMENT_ID/destinations/postmanQueue/messages?pollingTime=10000&batchSize=1&lockTtl=10000&payloadVisibility=conditional" \
-H "Authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache" 
----


[[mqstatapi]]
== Anypoint MQ Stats API

The Anypoint MQ Stats API enables you to get statistics and metrics for queues and message exchanges.

You can use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-mq-stats/[Anypoint MQ Stats API^] to perform statistical analysis of queue performance.

Use the Stats API to retrieve:

* Anypoint MQ metrics:
** Near real-time statistics for queues
** Historical statistics for queues
** Historical statistics for message exchanges
* Usage metrics
+
View your entire organization's usage of Anypoint MQ for billing purposes:
+
** Usage per environment
** Usage per organization
* Statistics for queues and message exchanges  
* Number of messages currently in a queue

[NOTE]
include::partial$mq-api-shared.adoc[tag=mqStatsAPIlimits]


For more information, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-mq-stats/[Anypoint MQ Stats API^] in the MuleSoft developer portal.

[[get-stats-access-token]]
=== Get the Stats API Access Token

[NOTE]
To access the Anypoint MQ Stats API, you must first authenticate using the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/access-management-api/[Anypoint Access Management API^].

To use the Stats API, you can get the access token from the Anypoint Platform user.
The access token is also known as the Bearer.
The default time to live (TTL) for the access token is 60 minutes.
You can get the organization ID and environment ID in the `payload.txt` file that Anypoint Platform creates for any auditable action in MQ. See xref:access-management::audit-logging.adoc#to-query-audit-logging-for-anypoint-mq[MQ Audit Logging]. 

Use this `curl` command to get the access token:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache" \
-d '{"username":"USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}'
----

This command returns output similar to:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "access_token": "42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "redirectUrl": "/home/"
}
----

=== Get Current Statistics for Queues

You can get a snapshot of the number of messages in the queue and how many are in-flight. 
See xref::mq-understanding.adoc#glossary[Anypoint MQ Terminology] for a definition of in-flight messages.
The data updates in almost real-time.

Stats API responses and message status changes include up to 60 seconds of inconsistency due to internal post-processing activities.
Message status changes include from in-queue to in-flight, from in-flight to in-queue, and from in-flight to deleted.
For this reason, don't use the Stats API for syncing processing actions,
such as checking if the queue is empty.

The Stats API can fetch statistics for multiple queues and returns a comma-separated list.

`/queues?destinationIds={queue1},{queue2}`

*Sample Request and Response:*

Use this `curl` command to get current statistics for a queue:

----
[source,bash]
curl -X GET "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/mq/stats/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/environments/ENVIRONMENT_ID/regions/REGION_URL/queues?destinationIds=DESTINATION_ID" \
-H "Authorization: bearer BEARER_TOKEN" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache"
----

This command returns output similar to:

----
[source,json,linenums]
 {
    "destination": "95bgpyxYsVyFE",
    "messages": 0,
    "inflightMessages": 0
 }
----

[[historical-stats-queue]]
=== Get Historical Statistics for a Queue

This API can be used to fetch historical statistics for a queue, however, it does not get updated in real-time, and there is an approximate latency of 5 to 10 minutes before data is published. The retention period of historical data is 15 months. Also, to keep the volume of data under control, historical data is stored at reduced levels of granularity. Data points with a period of fewer than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours, one-minute data points are available for 15 days, five-minute data points for 63 days, and one-hour data points for 15 months.

`/queues/{queueId}?startDate=...&endDate=...&period=...`

*Sample Request and Response:*

Use this `curl` command to get historical statistics for a queue:

[source,bash]
----

            "value": 0
        }
     ]
}
----

Note that period is an integer here. It's the granularity of data points in seconds.

[[usage-by-env]]
=== Get Usage Metrics by Environment 

You can use the Stats API to retrieve Anypoint MQ usage information by environment for a particular organization:

== Create Queues and Exchanges with Groovy

To create queues and exchanges programatically, you can use a language such as groovy.

The following example consists of the `cloudhub.properties` file in which
you list the queues and exchanges to create, and a script file that
references the properties file.

=== Date Format

Anypoint MQ lets you specify start and end dates for the Stats API in standard ISO 8601 format.

For example: `2018-10-23T13:00:00Z`

=== Invoke a Command

After modifying the properties file for access to your Anypoint Platform account, use this command to start the
script file:

`groovy <program_name>.groovy`

=== Configure a Properties File

The following example properties file defines the access credentials,
organization ID, environment ID, region ID,
and the names of the queues and exchanges to create:

[source,text,linenums]
----
username="<anypoint_platform_username>"
password="<anypoint_platform_password>"
organizationID="ORGANIZATION_ID"
environmentID {
    development="DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_ID"
    qa="QA_ENVIRONMENT_ID"
    staging="STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_ID"
    production="PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_ID"
}
regionID="REGION_URL"

queues=[
    "Queue1",
    "Queue2",
    "QueueN",
]

exchanges=[
    "Exchange1",
    "Exchange2",
    "ExchangeN"
]
----

See the xref:mq-faq#regions[Anypoint MQ FAQ] for the regions where Anypoint MQ and FIFO queues are available.

=== Create a Script File

This example script creates the queues and exchanges listed in the properties file:

== Test Anypoint MQ from Postman, Studio, and a Browser

This example enables you to test Anypoint MQ from Postman, Anypoint Studio, and a browser:

* <<postsetup,Postman>>
* <<studiosetup,Anypoint Studio>>
* <<browsersetup,Browser>>

[[postsetup]]
=== Set Up Postman

The https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman^] app provides a platform for accessing the Anypoint MQ APIs.
After downloading and installing Postman, supply this information to create an environment:

* ORGANIZATION_ID
* ENVIRONMENT_ID
* Bearer (Authentication) Token
* Host ID (from Anypoint Platform/Anypoint MQ)
* Client ID (from Anypoint Platform/Anypoint MQ)
* Client Secret (from Anypoint Platform/Anypoint MQ)
* Queue name (you can set this queue name in Postman)

After you authorize access to an Anypoint MQ API, you can then publish a message, consume the message, and get the lock ID from the returned information in the body.

For example, this information is returned from the consume (GET) command:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "properties": {
      "anotherUserDefinedHeader": "Random stuff",
      "userDefinedHeader": "User defined stuff"
    },
    "headers": {
      "messageId": "514",
      "lockId": "<lockIDvalue>",
      "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:17:57 GMT",
      "deliveryCount": "2"
    },
    ...
----

After you have the lock ID, you can add it to your Postman environment to facilitate future requests.

[[studiosetup]]
=== Set Up Studio for API Access

Anypoint Studio enables you to create a Mule app that uses the Anypoint MQ connector.
This section summarizes the steps.

You can set up a Studio project with:

* An HTTP connector: 
  ** Host `0.0.0.0`
  ** Port `8081`
  ** Path in the properties menu set to `/mq/{messageId}`.
* Anypoint MQ connector with the client ID and client secret from *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*, and the *Destination* set to the queue you created in Postman.
* Logger with *Message* set to the `\#[payload]` value.

. Right-click the project name in the *Package Explorer* window and click *Run As > Mule Application*.
+
Ensure that the Console messages end with the `DEPLOYED` value.
. In Postman, publish a new message.

[[browsersetup]]
==== Use a Browser to Access

After you set up an HTTP Listener in Studio, browse to the address `0.0.0.0:8081`. The browser displays the message sent by Postman, which the Anypoint MQ connector received, and the HTTP connector sent to the browser.

== Download Anypoint MQ APIs from Exchange

To download the Anypoint MQ APIs from Exchange, click *Download* and select the format to download: RAML, OAS, or as a connector file for Mule 3 or Mule 4.
