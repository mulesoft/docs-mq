== Give Users Anypoint MQ Access Permissions

First, give yourself Anypoint MQ access permissions and then give others in your organization access.

Assign user permissions to yourself for use with Anypoint MQ.
These permissions enable you to create client applications and destinations by creating queues and exchanges.
You can use the same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions, follow the steps in xref:access-management::users.adoc#grant-user-permissions[Grant Permissions to Users].

== Use Teams to Assign Permissions

Use the Teams feature to create groups of users and then assign the members of those groups certain permissions.

For example, you can create an admin team with manage permissions or a user team with just view permissions.
Creating a role enables you to assign access rights to users in your organization, such as administrators, developers, or users (who only view information but don't change it).

Follow the steps in xref:access-management::teams.adoc[].

== Switch Environments

To switch environments:

. In Anypoint Platform, go to *MQ* > *Design*.

. In the *Switch Environment* box, switch to a different environment or change your default environment:
** To switch to a different environment, click the name of that environment (for example, *Sandbox*, if you previously created a sandbox environment) and then click *Switch*.
** To change your default environment, click *Open your profile to change the default environment* and choose a different environment from the *Default* environment list.
