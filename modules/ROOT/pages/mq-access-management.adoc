Anypoint Platform enables you to manage the roles of users who administer the Anypoint MQ features in Anypoint Platform for your organization.

== Create an Environment

Before you give yourself Anypoint MQ access permissions, create an environment with which to associate permissions:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Access Management*
. Follow the steps in xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[To Create a New Environment].

== Give Users Anypoint MQ Access Permissions

First, give yourself Anypoint MQ access permissions and then give others in your organization access.

Assign user permissions to yourself for use with Anypoint MQ.
These permissions enable you to create client applications and destinations by creating queues and exchanges.
You can use the same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions:

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management*.
. Follow the steps in xref:access-management::users.adoc#grant-user-permissions[Grant Permissions to Users].
// image::mq-acc-mgmt-user-detail.png[MQ permissions in Access Management]
// . Click and select an item from the *Permissions* menu:

== Use Teams to Assign Permissions

Use the Teams feature to create groups of users and then assign the members of those groups certain permissions.

For example, you can create an admin team with manage permissions or a user team with just view permissions.
Creating a role enables you to assign access rights to users in your organization, such as administrators, developers, or users (who only view information but don't change it).

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management*.
. Follow the steps in xref:access-management::teams.adoc[].
