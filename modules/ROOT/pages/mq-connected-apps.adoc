= Configuring Connected Apps

The Connected Apps feature enables you to integrate external applications with Anypoint Platform by providing access to those applications without sharing your user credentials.

When you create a connected app, Access Management lists the ID and secret for the app.
You use the ID and secret values when configuring Anypoint Connector for MQ (Anypoint MQ Connector) in a Mule app in Anypoint Studio.

Use this ID and secret to get the access token required to authenticate with the Anypoint MQ API.

. When you configure Anypoint MQ Connector in your Mule app, paste the ID and secret values in the *Anypoint MQ Config* window in Studio:
