= Configuring Client Apps

Client apps enable you to generate credentials to use to publish and consume from a queue.

[IMPORTANT]
MuleSoft recommends that you use connected apps rather than client apps to generate credentials.
For information, see xref:mq-connected-apps.adoc[].

When you register a client app, Anypoint MQ lists the client ID and client secret for the app.
You use the client ID and client secret values when configuring Anypoint Connector for MQ (Anypoint MQ Connector) in a Mule app in Anypoint Studio.

An app does not have to exist for you to register it with Anypoint MQ Connector.


== Register a Client App 

include::partial$mq-shared-client-apps.adoc[tags=mqRegisterClientApp,tags=!excludeClientApp]

. Click *Copy* to copy the client app ID or client secret value to your clipboard.
. When you configure Anypoint MQ Connector in your Mule app, paste the client app ID and client secret values to the *Anypoint MQ Config* window in Studio:

== Regenerate a Client Secret 

You might need to regenerate the client secret for a client app ID if your organization's security policy requires that you change client secrets on a schedule.

Another reason you might need to regenerate the client secret is to revoke access to a client ID by a specific consumer or publisher.
In this case, you can regenerate the client secret in Anypoint MQ and reconfigure the secret in only those apps for which you want to allow access.

To regenerate the client secret:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Client Apps* in the navigation pane.
. Click the client app name to display the details pane.
. Click *Regenerate Secret*:

== Delete a Client App

To delete a client app:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Client Apps* in the navigation pane.
. Click the client app name to display the details pane.
. Click *Delete*:
