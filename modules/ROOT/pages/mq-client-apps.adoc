= Configuring Client Apps

When using Anypoint Connector for MQ (Anypoint MQ Connector) version 3.x or earlier,
you create a client app to generate credentials to use to publish and consume from a queue.

include::partial$mq-connect-apps.adoc[tag=mqConnAppRec]

When you create a client app, Anypoint MQ lists the client ID and client secret for the app.
You use the client ID and client secret values when configuring Anypoint MQ Connector in a Mule app in Anypoint Studio.
include::partial$mq-client-id-secret.adoc[tag=mqClientIdSecret]

An app does not have to exist for you to register it with Anypoint MQ Connector.


== Create a Client App 

To create a client app:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Client Apps* in the navigation pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-create-client-apps.png["Client Apps option and Add icon"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. *Client Apps* displays and creates client apps.
.. *Add* icon adds a client app.
. Click the *Add* icon (image:icon-blue-plus.png["Add icon in Client Apps",2.5%,2.5%]).
. In the *Create Client App* window, enter the name of the client app, such as `DemoClientApp` and click *Save Changes*.
. Click the client app name to view the client app ID and client secret values in the details pane:
+
image::mq-tutorial-client-apps-detail.png["Client app name, Copy, and Show buttons"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Client app name displays client app details.
.. *Copy* buttons copy the client app ID or client secret value.
.. *Show* displays the client secret value, which is obfuscated by default.
. Click *Copy* to copy the client app ID or client secret value to your clipboard.
. When you configure Anypoint MQ Connector in your Mule app, paste the client app ID and client secret values to the *Anypoint MQ Config* window in Studio:

== Regenerate a Client Secret 

You might need to regenerate the client secret for a client app ID if your organization's security policy requires that you change client secrets on a schedule.

Another reason you might need to regenerate the client secret is to revoke access to a client ID by a specific consumer or publisher.
In this case, you can regenerate the client secret in Anypoint MQ and reconfigure the secret in only those apps for which you want to allow access.

To regenerate the client secret:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Client Apps* in the navigation pane.
. Click the client app name to display the details pane.
. Click *Regenerate Secret*:

== Delete a Client App

To delete a client app:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Client Apps* in the navigation pane.
. Click the client app name to display the details pane.
. Click *Delete*:
