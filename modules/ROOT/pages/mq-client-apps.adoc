= Configuring Client Apps

You can register a Mule app with Anypoint Connector for MQ (Anypoint MQ Connector). 
When the app is registered, Anypoint MQ lists the client ID and client secret for the app. 
Use the client ID and client secret values when configuring the connection types for Anypoint MQ Connector 
in a Mule app in Anypoint Studio.

You can also regenerate the client secret, if necessary.

. Click *MQ* in the Anypoint Platform menu or in the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Client Apps* in the left navigation pane.
. Click the blue plus (+) icon:

. Click *Save Changes*.

The client secret value is obfuscated unless you click *Show*:

* Click the *Copy* button for the client app ID or client secret to copy the value to your clipboard.

To delete the client app, click *Delete*.


== Regenerate a Client Secret 

You might need to regenerate the client secret for a client app ID if your organization's security policy requires that you change client secrets on a schedule.

Another reason you might need to regenerate the client secret is to revoke access to a client ID by a specific consumer or publisher.
In this case, you can regenerate the client secret in Anypoint MQ and reconfigure the secret in only those apps for which you want to allow access.

To regenerate the client secret:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in the Anypoint Platform menu or in the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Client Apps* from the left navigation pane.
. Click the client app entry to view the client app ID and client secret value in the details pane.
. Click *Regenerate Secret*:
+
.The arrow shows the *Regenerate Secret* icon in the details pane.
