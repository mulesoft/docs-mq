= Configuring Cross-Region Failover for Standard Queues

You can configure failover by specifying a fallback region for standard queues using Anypoint Connector for Anypoint MQ (Anypoint MQ Connector) for Mule 4 version 4.0.9 and later.

* To use the failover feature with the default region, use connector version 4.0.7 or later.
* To configure a specific failover region, use connector version 4.0.9 or later.

When you enable failover for a queue, Anypoint MQ automatically creates a fallback queue in a default or custom <<primary-fallback-regions,fallback region>>.
If a Mule app can't reach an Anypoint MQ server in a region,
it switches to the fallback queue to publish and consume messages.
For information about situations that can cause a region to be considered unavailable, see <<region-unavailability>>.

IMPORTANT: This feature provides _resiliency_ by switching to a fallback queue in a fallback region when the primary region is down.
It doesn't provide _data redundancy_ by replicating messages across the primary and fallback queues. 

When the connector detects that the primary region is down, it:

* Switches to the fallback queue to publish and consume new messages.
* Periodically checks if the primary region is back up.
+
When the connector detects that it can communicate with the primary region,
it switches processing back to the primary queue.
The consumer continues to read from the fallback queue until all messages in that queue are processed.

The fallback queue inherits the settings of the primary queue, such as message TTL (time-to-live) and default acknowledgment timeout.
// Fallback queues aren't configurable by end users
include::partial$mq-failover.adoc[tag=fallbackQnotConfig]

You can disable failover, but you can't delete the fallback queue.
When you disable failover for a queue, apps can still consume any messages that remain in the fallback queue but can't publish new messages to it.

== Failover Limitations and Considerations

* Failover Support
+
** This feature is not enabled by default.
+
For information about enabling this feature in your app, see 
xref:anypoint-mq-connector::anypoint-mq-failover.adoc#enable-failover-feature[Enable Failover in Your App].
** Failover support requires Anypoint MQ Connector 4.0.7 or later.
** Custom fallback region support requires Anypoint MQ Connector 4.0.9 or later.
// +
// xref to upgrade steps?
** Failover is supported for standard queues only.
** Failover isn't supported for message exchanges or FIFO queues.
* Fallback Regions
+
--
** Because MuleSoft Government Cloud includes only one region, it does not support failover.
** Anypoint MQ is available in only one region in some countries.
+
If failover is enabled for queues in those regions and the primary region goes down,
data resides in a region outside the country until the primary region is available.
To change the fallback region, upgrade to Anypoint MQ Connector 4.0.9 or later.
--
+
For the list of default fallback regions, see <<primary-fallback-regions>>.
* Authentication
+
If access management is unavailable when the connector switches to the fallback region,
the connector might not be able to switch to the fallback region if it can't validate the access token.
* Anypoint MQ UI
+
The *Message Sender* and *Message Browser* in the Anypoint MQ UI don't support the failover feature.
+
When you xref:mq-queues.adoc#send-message-to-queue[send a message] using the *Message Sender*, the message is published to the specified queue and appears in the *Message Browser*.
However, if the primary region is down, the message is not forwarded to the fallback queue, so it doesn't appear in the *Message Browser* for the fallback queue.
* Performance and Billing
+
The Consumer and Subscriber operations in Anypoint MQ Connector periodically check the fallback queue for new messages.
Each request counts against your monthly 
xref:mq-usage.adoc#api-requests[API request] quota.
These checks can also cause latency.
+
Publishing to or consuming from the fallback queue might be slower than with the primary queue due to the checks and the expected network latency of processing from a queue in a different region.
+
You can configure how frequently the connector checks the fallback queue. See xref:anypoint-mq-connector::anypoint-mq-failover.adoc#configure-check-frequency[Configure the Frequency of Fallback Queue Checks].

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

To use failover, you must first:

* Upgrade Anypoint MQ Connector to 4.0.7 or later (default fallback region) or 4.0.9 or later (custom fallback region).
+
For information, see xref:anypoint-mq-connector::anypoint-mq-connector-upgrade-migrate.adoc[].
* Enable the failover feature in your app.
+
For information, see xref:anypoint-mq-connector::anypoint-mq-failover.adoc#enable-failover-feature[Enable Failover in Your App].

[[enable-failover]]
== Enable Failover for a New or Existing Queue

Enabling cross-region failover creates a fallback queue in a <<primary-fallback-regions,fallback region>>.

NOTE: If either the primary or fallback region is unavailable, enabling failover via the Anypoint MQ UI or REST API might not work.

// Configure DLQ before enabling failover
include::partial$mq-failover.adoc[tag=fallbackDLQ]

To enable failover for a new or existing queue:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Create a queue or modify an existing queue:
+
[tabs]
====
Create a queue::
+
.. Click the *Add* icon to display the menu:
+

== View Fallback Queue Details

To view failover configuration for the primary and fallback queues, display the queue details:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue type to display its details, including the failover configuration.
+
** The queue details pane for the primary queue includes the fallback queue:

... Queue type displays the queue details pane for the fallback queue.
+
The fallback queue can't be deleted.
... The name of the primary queue is the fallback queue name without the `_fb` suffix.


[[disable-failover]]
== Disable Failover for a Queue

When you disable failover for a queue, apps can still consume any messages that remain in the queue but can't send new messages to the queue.

IMPORTANT: When you disable failover for a queue, you must restart all applications that consume from or send to the queue.

When you re-enable failover, Anypoint MQ reinstates the same fallback queue.

To process any messages that remain in the fallback queue after disabling failover, see 
xref:anypoint-mq-connector::anypoint-mq-failover.adoc#consume-directly-fallback[Process Messages Directly from the Fallback Queue].

To disable failover for a queue:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and click *MQ* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue name.
. In the *Queue Settings* page, deselect *Enable Cross-Region Failover*
+
Anypoint MQ disables failover for the queue:
+
image::mq-queue-settings-failover-disabled.png["Queue Settings page with failover option deselected"]
. Click *Save Changes*.
+
The primary queue details shows that failover is disabled:
+
image::mq-queue-details-primary-queue-fallback-disabled.png["Details pane for the primary queue with the fallback queue and failover status"]
. Restart all applications consuming from or publishing to the queue.


[[primary-fallback-regions]]
== Default Primary-Fallback Regions

By default, Anypoint MQ Connector uses the default primary-fallback region pairings.

With version 4.0.9 and later of the connector, you can specify the fallback region, for example,
to prevent data from residing in a different country for compliance reasons.

IMPORTANT: To minimize latency, use the default fallback region.

[[region-note-unavailable]]
^***^ {empty}
Because Anypoint MQ is available in only one region in this country, 
the fallback region is not in the same country as the primary region.

[[region-note]]
^****^ {empty}
The fallback region for this region is not in the same country as the primary region.

[[region-unavailability]]
== Region Unavailability

The connector considers a region as unavailable in cases where the Anypoint MQ backend server is:

* Down, resulting in HTTP 5xx (Server Error) status codes to the connector.
* Up, but is slow or unresponsive.
+
For example, the connector receives Timeout errors while making REST API calls to the backend server.
* Available in some situations, but not others.
+
For example, unresponsive for queues, but available for other usage, such as message exchanges.

When the connector receives an HTTP 5xx or any server-side error,
it temporarily marks the region as down for the specific queue and switches to the fallback queue.

The connector periodically checks for new messages in the primary queue to determine if the primary region is back up.
You can change the frequency of these checks.
For information, see xref:anypoint-mq-connector::anypoint-mq-failover.adoc#configure-check-frequency[Configure the Frequency of Fallback Queue Checks].
