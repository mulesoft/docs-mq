= Configuring Cross-Region Failover for Standard Queues

Anypoint MQ Connector provides failover capability for standard queues.

When enabled for a queue, if a Mule app can't reach an Anypoint MQ server in a region, it switches to the fallback queue configured in a different region.

== Failover Limitations

* Failover is supported for standard queues only.
* MuleSoft Government Cloud includes only one region so does not support failover.
